# Analysis: Distribution Network Investment for Mandatory Solar

## Summary
**Source**: LinkedIn comment from Jordan Taylor (The Electric Brit | SHESQ Advisor and Engineer at National Grid)  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Research & Analysis  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

## Problem
Jordan Taylor highlighted that "solar becoming mandatory on new builds is going to require massive investment into distribution networks to handle it." This is a critical infrastructure challenge that needs detailed analysis in the book.

## Current Status
- Mandatory solar on new builds is becoming policy in some areas
- Distribution network capacity constraints are not fully covered
- Grid investment requirements for distributed generation need analysis
- Connection between policy and infrastructure investment unclear

## Tasks

### Research Tasks
1. **Policy Analysis**
   - [ ] Review current and proposed mandatory solar policies
   - [ ] Analyze implementation timeline and scope
   - [ ] Identify affected regions and housing types
   - [ ] Document policy variations across UK

2. **Infrastructure Impact Assessment**
   - [ ] Calculate additional solar capacity from mandatory installations
   - [ ] Analyze distribution network capacity in affected areas
   - [ ] Estimate required network upgrades and investments
   - [ ] Model grid impact during peak generation periods

3. **Investment Analysis**
   - [ ] Quantify investment requirements for distribution networks
   - [ ] Compare costs vs. benefits of network upgrades
   - [ ] Analyze funding mechanisms and cost allocation
   - [ ] Include timeline and phasing of investments

4. **Technical Solutions**
   - [ ] Explore smart grid technologies for managing distributed generation
   - [ ] Analyze battery storage as grid buffer (Ben's suggestion)
   - [ ] Review demand response and flexible load options
   - [ ] Consider grid-scale storage solutions

### Content Development
- [ ] New section on distribution network challenges
- [ ] Integration with smart grid and flexibility content
- [ ] Connection to renewable energy policy discussions
- [ ] Analysis of grid modernization requirements

## Deliverables
- Investment analysis with quantified network upgrade costs
- Technical solutions for managing distributed solar
- Policy recommendations for implementation
- Updated content on grid infrastructure challenges

## Notes
This addresses a critical infrastructure challenge identified by a National Grid engineer. The disconnect between renewable energy policy and grid infrastructure investment is a key theme that deserves comprehensive analysis in the book.
