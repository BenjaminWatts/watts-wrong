# Chapter 4: NIMBYs & Onshore Wind Ban - The Planning Disaster

In Britain today, the total capacity of wind farms is about 30GW. If you look at a [map](https://renewables-map.robinhawkes.com) of British wind farms, it's likely the first observations you'll have are:

- **The North Sea is dominant**: About 50% (15GW) of wind capacity is offshore, three-quarters (12GW) of which is in the North Sea.
- **Scotland is covered with windfarms**: About 30% (10GW) of wind capacity is onshore and in Scotland. 

It's tempting to think this is a rational and logical distribution. After all:

- **The North Sea makes sense** It's much easier to build wind turbines offshore in the North Sea than elsewhere. It's incredibly shallow; it's only 15-30 metres deep 80-125 miles from the coast at Dogger Bank. North Sea oil and gas has been exploited for 60 years; it's well mapped and there are many ports on the east coast with the infrastructure and facilities to construct and maintain the infrastructure. It's also adjacent to major energy trading partners and power grids in Germany, Nordics (Denmark/Norway), the Netherlands/Belgium; whereas the west coast only borders Ireland.
- **Scotland is wild and windy** Scotland has 8 times fewer people per square mile than England (70 vs 1,100 people per square mile). Land costs are dramatically lower too - agricultural land in Scotland averages around £4,000 per acre compared to £10,000-15,000 per acre in much of England, with prime farmland in the South East reaching £20,000+ per acre.

## NIMBYism

However, politics is as influential as climate and economics. Since the first onshore wind farm in Britain was built in Delabole, Cornwall in 1991, some local residents have been reluctant to accept wind farms. Interestingly, much of the opposition to the Delabole project focused on noise abatement; today, visual disturbance tends to be the top concern, along with construction traffic and disruption.

Wind farms are relatively unique in Britain for bringing into conflict two quite different groups of stakeholders. On the one hand, you have the developers; typically working-age urbanites who are highly educated and strongly focused on national and international climate challenges and supply chains. On the other hand, you have local communities with a more diverse age range, including many retired and non-working groups, for most of whom their home if they're lucky to own it represents their largest financial asset or pool of savings.

As Britain has a national grid with uniform pricing, there are no automatic bill savings for communities located close to wind farms. With the recent rejection of regional (and zonal) pricing; this looks set to remain the case for the large part; however there are [ways](https://www.elexon.co.uk/bsc/mod-proposal/p441/) for groups of energy users and generators the same energy supplier and primary substation to avoid some grid levies for electricity. 

Given how complex the planning and engineering can be, if a developer or operator of a wind farm disturbs the day-to-day life of local communities, getting recourse or compensation through legal means against a large private company is likely to be too intimidating for most local communities, even if they can organize together.

The center right (i.e. the Conservative party) of British politics has long harboured a scepticism for wind and solar, and despite the need for state financial support has preferred nuclear energy. Following their return to office in 2010 and coupled with the rapid expansion of onshore wind farms at the in conservative leaning rural districts, the Government in 2015 effectively banned any new onshore wind in England. In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland the decision was taken by their respective Governments to continue with onshore wind. The decision in England was a mistake which was particularly profound because of the lack of mitigation for the consequences:

1. Connect and manage - Britain took the view that it was acceptable for wind developers to build projects in areas that were poorly served by the national and local distribution grids. This meant a lack of coordination between projects being built and the local grid being upgraded to accommodate them. When the two weren't in sync, the result was—and continues to be—that wind farms are compensated for being turned off (or down), which now costs £3-4 billion per year.

Had more wind farms been built in areas like Devon/Cornwall and the Pennines, there would have been fewer grid problems because the biggest constraints are north/south, especially across the Scottish border. Additionally, because demand would be closer to generation, there would also be smaller losses in transporting electricity long distances through cables. The current concentration of wind farms in Scotland and the North Sea creates a bottleneck where power has to flow south through limited transmission capacity, while England's southern regions remain heavily dependent on imported electricity, both from abroad and further north.

2. Unequal jobs/benefits - Much of rural England struggles for quality, year-round jobs. By forcing more of the onshore wind North of the Border, the Conservative Government robbed deprived parts of the Westcountry, Pennines, Northumbria, and other windy regions of England that could have benefited from wind farm development. This is particularly problematic because the windiest parts of England tend to be the poorest and most isolated—areas like Cornwall, the Pennines, Northumberland, and parts of Yorkshire. These regions are typically:
   - Further from major cities and economic hubs
   - Lacking high-quality arable farmland (often only suitable for sheep farming or marginal agriculture)
   - Struggling with depopulation and limited employment opportunities
   - In need of economic development and infrastructure investment

Wind farms could have provided these communities with construction jobs, ongoing maintenance work, and annual payments to landowners—often the only significant income some of these areas see. Instead, these benefits were concentrated in Scotland, leaving England's windy but economically deprived regions without this potential lifeline.

In contrast, many parts of rural Scotland have attracted large numbers of engineers—both working for the onshore wind developments and for the grid infrastructure that facilitates them. Having a year-round job with significant training and investment from a large employer is often difficult to find in rural areas, but can offer a much more stable quality of living to many rural people of working age. These skilled positions provide not just employment, but career development opportunities that are rare in isolated rural communities.

By keeping and indeed attracting new people of working age to an area, this sort of development also helps to preserve other parts of the social fabric such as keeping schools, shops, pubs, and medical facilities open. Rural depopulation is a vicious cycle—as young people leave for better opportunities elsewhere, local services close, making the area even less attractive to families and businesses. Wind farm development can break this cycle by providing stable, well-paid employment that allows people to stay in their communities and support local services. Energy related jobs also enable people to finance mortgages and buy homes in rural areas. Without stable employment, many rural communities become dominated by second homes, holiday lets, and retirees, with few young families able to put down roots. Wind farm development creates the economic foundation that allows working-age people to build lives in rural communities rather than being forced to move to cities for employment opportunities.

This creates a chicken and egg problem: because there are few working-age people in rural areas to advocate for economic development and renewable infrastructure, local politics becomes dominated by older, close to and retired people. These residents typically have less focus on economic development—especially job market expansion—and more focus on preserving the asset value of their homes and maintaining the "character" of their communities. Older residents naturally focus more on the short-term disruption of construction rather than any longer term benefits. This political dynamic makes it even harder to attract the very development that could bring working-age people back, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of rural decline.

This represents a clear tragedy of the commons failure: while each local community rationally seeks to avoid hosting renewable energy infrastructure (to preserve views, property values, and local character), the collective result is a suboptimally low amount of renewable energy deployment nationally. Without national coordination and the ability to force through renewable infrastructure projects, Britain will continue to fall short of its climate targets and energy security needs, while individual communities remain trapped in cycles of economic decline and political opposition to the very development that could help them. 

## UK Diversification

When learning about investment portfolios, one of the first lessons you learn is to reduce risk by diversifying. Certain assets decline while others rise, smoothing out overall returns. There's a direct parallel with the distribution and location of wind farms around the UK.

While some areas are outright windier than others (Scotland vs. the South East), the real benefit comes from geographic diversification. Not just that, but often when it's windy in one part of the country, it's less windy elsewhere. Much of our weather consists of fronts emerging from the North Atlantic. Often these hit the northern part of Britain (e.g., Scotland) harder, occasionally the south. Sometimes these fronts hit the UK at a different angle, tracking from the south-west, west, or north-west. And because wind speeds tend to be strongest around the line of the weather front, there is almost always a timing lag between a weather front hitting one part of the UK and the other.

Some weather systems move from west to east, others from south-west to north-east, creating complex patterns where wind generation varies significantly across different regions at different times. This geographic and temporal variation means that a well-distributed portfolio of wind farms across Britain would provide much more stable and predictable generation than concentrating all capacity in just a few areas.

The current concentration of wind farms in Scotland and the North Sea creates a "single point of failure" problem. When weather conditions are unfavourable in those regions (which can happen for days or even weeks during certain seasons), Britain's renewable generation drops dramatically. A diversified portfolio would include more:

- **Coastal wind farms** in Cornwall, Devon, Wales and Western Scotland (exposed to Atlantic weather systems)
- **Upland wind farms** in the Pennines and Northumberland (benefiting from orographic effects - where wind is forced upward by hills and mountains, creating higher wind speeds and more consistent generation)
- **Southern and eastern wind farms** (catching different weather patterns, especially in the Channel)

This diversification would reduce the volatility of renewable generation, decrease the need for expensive backup generation, and improve Britain's overall energy security. The onshore wind ban in England has prevented this diversification, leaving Britain's renewable energy portfolio dangerously concentrated and vulnerable to regional weather variations.

## European Diversification

Even with a diversified UK portfolio of wind and solar assets, the UK remains a relatively small country with a relatively confined climate. Having access to trade electricity with the wider continent allows the UK to benefit from changes in weather patterns over a much larger area, exporting at times of surplus and importing surpluses elsewhere at times of scarcity back home. As noted in [Chapter 17](./17-brexit-friction.md), Brexit has introduced extra friction to short-term electricity trading of the sort which is particularly helpful in balancing renewables. However, the construction of 5 new interconnectors since 2016 has thankfully still occurred despite these challenges.
