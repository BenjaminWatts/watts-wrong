# Chapter 21: Shale Gas - A Missed Opportunity

## Introduction

As a passionate environmentalist who believes in climate change, I'm more aware than most how incredibly sensitive shale gas is as a topic. Though the prospect has largely been abandoned, when it was discussed more frequently, I heard pretty misleading arguments on both sides of the debate. This chapter examines what UK shale gas development could have meant for our energy security, economy, and environment - and why it was ultimately rejected.

## The Economic Case for UK Shale Gas

### Energy Security Benefits

Had we invested more in domestic energy sources like nuclear, wind and shale gas, then we might have paid more upfront for the energy, particularly the investment required. However, much of that investment would have stayed within the UK economy, we would have better infrastructure and assets, and during energy price shocks like 2022, our economy would have been more insulated. This is true even if domestic energy producers had been allowed to increase their prices, provided we had sensible profit (including if needed, windfall) taxes in place to collect and redistribute.

### Tax Revenue Generation

Oil and gas production is about the most heavily taxed sector of the economy. And that's before you factor in taxes on petrol and diesel, but focusing on the production of gas and crude oil. Whereas most businesses pay corporation tax at 25% (smaller businesses pay 19%), oil and gas companies pay 40% corporation tax plus additional levies, bringing their total effective tax rate to around 65-75% on profits. Plus, salaries in oil and gas are on average £65,000-75,000 per year, roughly double the national average of around £35,000. This means each oil and gas worker generates around £19,500 more in total tax revenue annually than the average worker (including income tax, employee NI, and employer NI) - a substantial additional contribution to the Treasury.

For every £1 spent on gas produced in the UK, around 21-27p goes back in tax revenue to the Treasury (including corporation tax, additional levies, and taxes on workers' wages). For LNG gas imported from the US or Qatar, it's more like 5p (being just the VAT) - meaning we're losing 16-22p in potential tax revenue for every pound spent on imported energy. When you consider our trade deficit on oil and gas of £25-35 billion per year, that represents a loss of £4-8 billion in potential tax revenue annually - money that could be funding public services, infrastructure investment, or tax cuts.

## Debunking Common Arguments

### Exploiting UK shale gas would not have reduced energy prices

If the UK had exploited its shale resources like the US, then the producers of the gas would have sold the gas at market prices. To do anything else would have required the Government to remove the UK from the global gas market, which would have been incompatible with our trading arrangements with Europe (before and after Brexit), and would have resulted in substantial litigation from other producers of oil and gas. Reducing gas prices in the UK would also have made it harder to secure any remaining imports needed from elsewhere, and would have reduced the profits (and tax revenue) from existing producers, which neither companies or Government would have wanted.

The UK never had globally significant quantities of shale gas. So while the production potential might have been significant domestically, it was never going to change the price within Europe or globally. This makes it incredibly hard to see how producing shale gas in the UK would have increased our consumption or use of gas.

### Exploiting UK shale gas would not have increased emissions

As discussed above, producing UK shale gas is very unlikely to have reduced the price of gas. The main impact it would have had would be replacing some (though likely not all) of the LNG we currently import from the US and Qatar with some domestically produced shale. 

In fact, UK shale gas would likely have been significantly lower-carbon than imported LNG. US shale-derived LNG, which makes up a substantial portion of our imports, has total lifecycle emissions of around 295-310 grams CO2e per kWh, including fracking, liquefaction, ocean transport, regasification, and the 200 grams CO2e per kWh from burning the gas itself. UK shale gas, by contrast, would eliminate these transport emissions and likely result in total emissions of around 251-268 grams CO2e per kWh - a 15-20% reduction in carbon footprint compared to US shale LNG. Even Qatari LNG, which is slightly cleaner at around 285-302 grams CO2e per kWh, would still be higher-carbon than domestic UK shale.

Had UK shale really taken off, then the most likely export market for the UK would have been the continent, with which we have two pipelines. Making such exports would have had much the same effect as using shale gas domestically, and would have displaced imports of LNG from the US and Qatar. So the same fundamentals hold.

Putting this together, exploiting UK shale would probably have reduced our emissions, though only fractionally.

## Why Did the UK Reject Shale Gas?

### Political Opposition and Electoral Pressure

If the Government and its advisors knew all this to be true, why did they really block shale gas? The answer is because of local opposition to the development of shale. The largest reserves in the UK were found in the Bowland-Hodder shale formation (stretching from Lancashire through Yorkshire to Staffordshire) and the Weald Basin (covering Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, and Kent). Lancashire alone contained four marginal constituencies where the Conservative majority was less than 1.5% in the 2019 election - Hyndburn (0.3% margin), Burnley (0.4% margin), Pendle (0.3% margin), and Rossendale & Darwen (1.1% margin). Meanwhile, the Weald Basin covers affluent Surrey constituencies like Surrey Heath and Woking, which are home to wealthy donors, business leaders, and politically connected individuals who can directly influence government policy and party funding. So the politics of protecting these key electoral areas trumped the longer-term economics for the rest of the country, resulting in a ban that has cost the UK economy billions in lost tax revenue and left us more dependent on foreign energy suppliers.

The form of opposition from these areas was very different - Lancashire saw grassroots environmental and community concerns, while Surrey and Hampshire experienced more organised, well-funded opposition from affluent residents with political connections. In a counterfactual world where the shale reserves had been located in different parts of the country, or had Labour been in power instead of the Conservatives, the government's decision might quite feasibly have been different. The ban was not inevitable - it was the result of specific political circumstances and the location of resources in politically sensitive areas.

### Environmental and Community Concerns

While the political opposition was significant, it's important to acknowledge that there were genuine environmental and community concerns about shale gas development. These included:

- **Water contamination risks** from fracking fluids
- **Seismic activity** concerns (though typically very minor)
- **Local environmental impact** from drilling operations
- **Community disruption** from increased industrial activity
- **Climate change concerns** about extending fossil fuel use

However, many of these concerns could have been addressed through proper regulation, environmental safeguards, and community engagement programs. The UK has some of the strictest environmental regulations in the world, and shale gas development could have been conducted to the highest environmental standards.

## The Counterfactual: What Could Have Been

### Economic Impact

Had UK shale gas development proceeded, the economic benefits could have been substantial:

- **Job creation:** Potentially 10,000-20,000 direct jobs in the sector
- **Tax revenue:** Billions in additional tax revenue annually
- **Energy security:** Reduced dependence on foreign gas suppliers
- **Balance of payments:** Improved trade balance through reduced imports
- **Regional development:** Economic benefits for Lancashire and other areas

### Energy Security Benefits

UK shale gas could have provided a significant buffer against global energy price shocks:

- **Price stability:** Domestic production would have insulated UK consumers from some international price volatility
- **Supply security:** Reduced reliance on politically unstable regions
- **Infrastructure development:** Investment in gas processing and distribution networks
- **Export potential:** Ability to export to European markets during periods of high demand

## Lessons for Energy Policy

### The Need for Better Decision-Making Frameworks

The shale gas experience highlights several important lessons for UK energy policy:

1. **National vs Local Interests:** Energy policy decisions should balance local concerns with national energy security and economic interests
2. **Evidence-Based Policy:** Decisions should be based on scientific evidence and economic analysis, not just political pressure
3. **Regulatory Framework:** Clear, consistent regulations that provide certainty for investors while protecting the environment
4. **Community Engagement:** Meaningful consultation and benefit-sharing with affected communities
5. **Long-term Planning:** Energy policy should look beyond electoral cycles to long-term national interests

### Alternative Approaches

Rather than banning shale gas entirely, alternative approaches could have included:

- **Pilot projects** in less politically sensitive areas
- **Strict environmental regulations** with independent monitoring
- **Community benefit funds** to share economic benefits with local areas
- **Phased development** to address concerns incrementally
- **Technology development** to improve environmental performance

## Conclusion

The UK's rejection of shale gas development represents a significant missed opportunity. While the environmental and community concerns were real and should not be dismissed, the economic and energy security benefits could have been substantial. The decision to ban shale gas development was ultimately driven more by political considerations than by a balanced assessment of the risks and benefits.

This experience highlights the need for better frameworks for making energy policy decisions that balance local concerns with national interests. Energy policy should be based on evidence and long-term planning rather than short-term political expediency. The UK's energy future depends on making better decisions about how to balance environmental protection, economic development, and energy security.

As we move forward with other energy technologies and face similar challenges with nuclear power, offshore wind, and other developments, the lessons from the shale gas experience should inform our approach to balancing local concerns with national energy needs.

# Chapter 20: How to Fix Britain's Energy System

## Introduction

After exploring 19 chapters of Britain's energy dysfunction, you might be wondering: is there any hope? The good news is that while Britain's energy system is broken, it's not beyond repair. The bad news is that fixing it will require fundamental changes to how we think about energy policy.

## What We've Learned

### The Scale of the Problem

Britain's energy system suffers from multiple interconnected failures:

- **Policy chaos** - constant flip-flopping and short-term thinking
- **Market dysfunction** - subsidies that create perverse incentives
- **Infrastructure neglect** - transmission constraints and planning failures
- **Consumer confusion** - complex pricing and poor information
- **International isolation** - Brexit friction and supply chain problems

### The Root Causes

Behind these failures lie deeper systemic issues:

1. **Political short-termism** - policy changes with every election
2. **Regulatory capture** - industry lobbying over public interest
3. **Silo thinking** - energy policy made in isolation from other sectors
4. **Target obsession** - meeting numbers without considering consequences

## The Alternative

If we don't fix the energy system:

- **Energy bills** will continue to rise
- **Blackouts** will become more frequent
- **Carbon emissions** will keep increasing
- **Energy security** will deteriorate
- **Britain will fall behind** other countries

## A Call to Action

Britain's energy system is broken, but it's not beyond repair. The solutions exist, the technology is available, and the political will can be built. What we need is:

1. **Honest conversation** about the scale of the problem
2. **Long-term thinking** that transcends election cycles
3. **Public engagement** in energy policy decisions
4. **International cooperation** despite political differences
5. **Investment in the future** rather than subsidies for the past

## Final Thoughts

Britain's energy dysfunction didn't happen overnight, and it won't be fixed overnight either. But with the right approach - systematic, long-term, and focused on the public interest - we can build an energy system that:

- **Powers our economy** reliably and affordably
- **Protects our environment** genuinely and sustainably
- **Serves our communities** fairly and transparently
- **Leads the world** in energy innovation and policy

The question isn't whether we can fix Britain's energy system - it's whether we have the courage to start.

## Summary

In this book, we've explored how Britain's energy system went wrong across five key areas:

- ✅ **Generation** - Biomass disasters, subsidy chaos, planning failures
- ✅ **Infrastructure** - Grid constraints, regional fragmentation, Scotland's isolation
- ✅ **Consumer markets** - Smart meter failures, hidden levies, price cap problems
- ✅ **Policy design** - Market dysfunction, emergency measures, Brexit friction
- ✅ **Human factors** - Timing issues, planning problems, political instability

The path to recovery is clear: stop making things worse, build the foundation, and transform the system. It won't be easy, cheap, or quick - but it's essential for Britain's future.
