# Chapter 11: Price Cap - The Sticking Plaster Solution

## Introduction

Though Labour lost the 2015 election to the Conservatives, high energy costs remained a pressing political issue. Over the following three years, average energy bills remained relatively stable, particularly for engaged consumers who actively compared and switched suppliers. However, concern continued to grow—along with political salience—over the premium that suppliers were charging to inactive customers, often the elderly and vulnerable.

With this mounting pressure, a price cap was introduced in 2018. Unlike the uniform regulated pricing found in monopolistic industries such as water, the energy price cap operates differently. Customers retain the freedom to choose tariffs from different suppliers. However, when customers fail to engage with the market, suppliers are obliged to place them on tariffs with rates at or below levels calculated quarterly by the regulator Ofgem.

The calculation process is extensive and thoroughly documented [online](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-regulation/domestic-and-non-domestic/energy-pricing-rules/energy-price-cap/energy-price-cap-default-tariff-levels), serving as essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the composition of household energy bills.
