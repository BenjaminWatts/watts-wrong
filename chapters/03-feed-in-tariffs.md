# Chapter 3: Feed-in Tariffs & RO - How Subsidies Went Wrong

## Introduction

It's often difficult for new technologies to get off the ground. Not only do you have to get the cost of manufacturing kit down, and the kit more reliable, but you also need a supply chain to distribute and an qualified workforce to install and maintain the equipment. This is particularly true if you want something installed en mass to millions of homnes and businesses, rather than in a handful of larger sites like power stations.

## PV

Solar PV is a watershed moment for making electricity. Unless every other way of making electricity, it doesn't rely on moving parts like spinning a generator. It therefore requires much less maintenance or frequent access. Given it's relatively light, thin and flat, it can also be readily installed on existing buildings (and sometimes ground). It also generates most electricity in the day time, when people are more likely to be awake, working and using electricity. And because it can be installed "behind the meter" of buildings, it offers the chance to bypass national and local energy grids and users to generate some of their own power.

### Feed in tariff

The UK isn't blessed with the world's sunniest climate, but despite this a well positioned kilowatt of PV panels will generate an average of about 1kwh of power in winter and 4kwh in summer. A typical house uses 3000-4000kwh of electricity in a year, and a typical roof can accommodate 3-5kw of PV panels, which depending where they are in the country can generate a similar amount (i.e. 3000-4000kwh) of electricity. Given the solar is skewed to the summer (and daytime), PV can't make a British home totally self-sufficient or offgrid, but it can typically reduce electricity consumption from the grid by about a third, along with some additional revenue from exports to the grid.

Seeing this potential, the (outgoing) Labour government in 2010 decided to launch a Feed-in Tariff, initially with a payment of 43.3p per kWh for every unit of solar electricity generated. Crucially, this payment is made even if the electricity is used onsite and never reaches the public grid. This was incredibly generous, at the time electricity from the grid typically cost just 8-12p per kWh. At the time, there were very few contractors able to install the equipment, and homeowners needed a strong incentive to consider the substantial financial investment. At the time in 2010, a typical installation could cost £12,000-15,000, so with the feed-in tariff offered the expected payback was around 8-10 years.

Given the Feed-in Tariff was guaranteed for 25 years in line with inflation, some of the oldest PV installations in the country are still turning their owners a tidy profit, indeed when uprated with inflation they are now earning around 71p per kWh, which for a typical 3kW installation represents an annual revenue of over £2,100. 

#### Boom bust

In the years following the adoption of the Feed in tariff in 2010, the number of installations started to grow, little at first but gradually more and more as the cost of installations fell and homeowner confidence grow behind the earliest adopters. However, as the price of the installations fell, installation interest only went up more as the payback period fell. This left the Government playing cat and mouse with the industry, as it started creating frequent deadlines when it would review and revise downward as deeemed appropriate the level feed-in-tariff subsidy. More and more installers entered the industry as well, operating at larger scale but at some sacrifice to the quality of workmanship. The pace of cuts to the feed-in tariff accelerated until March 2019, when the Government announced an end to new entrants to the scheme, with the final closure taking effect in April 2019.

The closure of the Feed in Tariff scheme creates a massive bust in the industry, as the replacement support vehicle, called the Smart Export Guarantee provides no support for generation unless it is exported to the grid.


#### Inequality and Legacy 

While the Feed-in Tariff scheme has now closed to new entrants, payments will continue until 2035 and its legacy lives on in several problematic ways:

**Wealth Inequality**: The scheme disproportionately benefited wealthier households who could afford the £12,000-15,000 upfront investment in the 2010s. This created a form of "solar aristocracy" where affluent homeowners received decades of premium payments while others missed out.

**Access Barriers**: The scheme was fundamentally unavailable to renters, flat-dwellers, and those without suitable roof space, creating a divide between property owners and those without access to suitable installation sites.

**Geographic Disparity**: Solar yields in Scotland are 20-30% lower than in southern England, meaning the scheme's benefits were geographically skewed toward wealthier, sunnier regions.

**Market Distortion**: The Feed-in Tariff was simple to understand and calculate paybacks, but its 25-year fixed duration takes no account of the declining value of solar generation during increasingly frequent periods of renewable energy abundance. This means early adopters continue receiving premium rates even when their electricity has minimal value to the grid.

**Financial Burden**: in common with other electricity levies (see [Chapter 10: Electricity Levies - Hidden Costs Everywhere](chapters/10-electricity-levies.md)), the cost of Feed in Tariffs was added to the electricity bills of all consumers. Those who consume more units of electricity contribute more, while users that buy less electricity from the grid (e.g. those with solar PV) pay less. In truth, the costs of the FIT scheme are quite modest compared to the Renewables Obligation (RO) scheme discussed later. According to [recent analysis by Ben James](https://climate.benjames.io/uk-electricity-bills/), the Feed-in Tariff represents a smaller portion of electricity bills - approximately 2.4% of a typical annual electricity bill in 2025. The FIT scheme closed to new applications in 2019, but payments to existing installations will continue until 2044, creating a long-term cost legacy that all electricity consumers must bear.

### Renewable Obligation Certificates (or ROCs)

Perhaps lesser known than the feed-in tariff these days, renewable obligation certificates were introduced as a way to increase the income received by early renewable projects plants connected to the grid. The scheme ran from 2002 to 2017, when it closed to new projects, though payments to existing installations continue until 2037. The main technology supported was wind power (both onshore and offshore), followed by biomass (including large-scale power stations like Drax) and hydroelectric projects.

In common with Contracts for Difference (CfD) support schemes, ROCs are only paid when generators are working and online, so the owner (rather than the taxpayer) is responsible for maintaining renewable generators in working order. This "performance-based" approach sounds sensible in theory - generators only get paid when they produce electricity.

According to [recent analysis](https://climate.benjames.io/uk-electricity-bills/), the Renewables Obligation only supports around 30% of Britain's renewable electricity generation, but still makes up around 10% of an average electricity bill. The RO scheme was particularly generous to both biomass projects like Drax and early offshore wind farms, which continue to receive premium payments. Early offshore wind projects under ROCs received around £140-150/MWh (in 2012 money), which in today's terms is roughly £200-220/MWh - significantly higher than current CfD prices of around £70-80/MWh for new offshore wind.

A major flaw of the ROCs scheme is the asymmetry of the support. They prop-up, or increase the revenue of renewable generators above the wholesale market price. However, if the wholesale market price spikes, there is no method for clawing back or reducing the support. These policy weaknesses contributed to the eventual replacement of ROCs with CfDs (see [Chapter 14: CfD vs Marginal Pricing - Market Design Disasters](chapters/14-cfd-vs-marginal-pricing.md)). However, no reform of existing ROCs has been attempted and during the 2022 energy crisis, the Government even refused to levy the windfall tax on ROC generators. The idea of reneging on the contracts has not been a maintream policy position under consideration by the previous Conservative and now Labour governments, however
