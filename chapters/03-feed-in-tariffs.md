# Chapter 3: Feed-in Tariffs & RO - How Subsidies Went Wrong

## Introduction

It's often difficult for new technologies to get off the ground. Not only do you have to get the cost of manufacturing kit down, and the kit more reliable, but you also need a supply chain to distribute and an qualified workforce to install and maintain the equipment. 

# PV

Solar PV is a watershed moment for making electricity. Unless every other way of making electricity, it doesn't rely on moving parts like spinning a generator. It therefore requires much less maintenance or frequent access. Given it's relatively light, thin and flat, it can also be readily installed on existing buildings (and sometimes ground). It also generates most electricity in the day time, when people are more likely to be awake, working and using electricity. And because it can be installed "behind the meter" of buildings, it offers the chance to bypass national and local energy grids and users to generate some of their own power.


## Feed in tariff

The UK isn't blessed with the world's sunniest climate, but despite this a well positioned kilowatt of PV panels will generate an average of about 1kwh of power in winter and 4kwh in summer. A typical house uses 3000-4000kwh of electricity in a year, and a typical roof can accommodate 3-5kw of PV panels, which depending where they are in the country can generate 3000-4000kwh of electricity. Given the solar is so heavilly skewed to the summer (and daytime), PV can't make a British home totally self-sufficient or offgrid, but it can reduce electricity consumption from the grid by about a third, and potentially some extra income selling surplus power to the grid. 

Seeing this potential, the Government in year x decided to launch a feed in tariff, initially with a paument of x p /kwh for every unit of solar electricity generated. This was incredibly generous, at the time electricity from the grid typically cost just x p / kwh. And given the feed in tariff was guanranteed for x years in line with inflation, some of the oldest PV installations in the country are now turning their owners a tidy profit.
