# Chapter 12: EPCs - Energy Performance Certificates That Don't Work

Energy Performance Certificates are supposed to inform users of the energy costs and environmental impact of buildings. There are separate certificates for residential homes and commercial premises. EPCs were introduced in the year 2007 [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Performance_Certificate_(United_Kingdom)) and are required whenever a building is offered for rent or sale.

For a variety of reasons, the EPC system as it exists at the moment is dysfunctional.

## Quality of Assessment
The current EPC can be undertaken by assessors with minimal training - typically just a few days of classroom instruction and some supervised assessments. The going rate for an EPC assessment is about £60-80, reflecting the low barriers to entry and the commoditized nature of the service. For most vendors and landlords, it is a tickbox exercise to satisfy legal requirements rather than a genuine attempt to understand or improve the property's energy performance.

The assessment process itself is heavily reliant on standardized assumptions rather than detailed analysis. Assessors typically spend 20-30 minutes in a property, taking basic measurements and checking for obvious features like double glazing, cavity wall insulation, and boiler types. Many factors that significantly affect energy performance - such as air tightness, thermal bridging, or the quality of installation - are either estimated from standard assumptions or completely ignored. It is a fact almost universally accepted that EPCs overestimate the heat loss of walls in most older houses, as the methodology assumes worst-case scenarios for thermal performance rather than accounting for the actual thermal mass and construction techniques used in traditional buildings. The result is that two identical properties can receive different EPC ratings depending on when they were assessed, who conducted the assessment, or even which version of the assessment software was used.

This variability undermines the credibility of EPCs as reliable indicators of energy performance. Personal experience bears this out - I've seen significant inconsistencies between EPCs on the same house over time, with insulation levels mysteriously falling between assessments despite no physical changes being made to the property. Even more concerning are the differences between houses clearly constructed at the same time on the same estate, where identical properties can receive different EPC ratings based purely on which assessor conducted the evaluation. Homeowners and buyers cannot trust that an EPC rating accurately reflects the actual energy efficiency of a property, making it difficult to make informed decisions about energy improvements or property purchases. 

## Outdated Emissions Methodology
For over a decade, EPCs were calculated using carbon factors agreed in 2012. Since then, Britain's electricity system has undergone a dramatic transformation. Coal generation has been phased out entirely, while wind and solar now provide over 40% of our electricity. But until June 2025, the methodology still assumed coal provided around 30% of electricity, calculating emissions at 450-500 g/CO2/kWh. This implied that a heat pump produced almost as much carbon (at around 130-150 g/CO2/kWh) as a gas boiler (around 210 g/CO2/kWh) - a claim that bore no resemblance to reality.

Given the actual carbon intensity of electricity is now around 115 g/CO2/kWh, a heat pump operating at 350% efficiency produces approximately 33 g/CO2/kWh - roughly 84% lower than a gas boiler. The RdSAP 10 methodology introduced in June 2025 finally updated these carbon factors, but millions of existing EPCs remain in circulation with the old figures, and the damage to heat pump adoption has already been done.

## Missing Outputs
The outputs shown on an Energy Performance Certificate focus around the annual costs and energy usage. Although the calculation framework considers each of the following, they are not presented to the end user:

### Variations in energy prices

The cost to run a house in an EPC uses standardised energy prices set by the methodology, updated periodically but not in line with market movements. Over the past decade there have been dramatic swings in energy costs, with electricity prices rising from around 14p/kWh in 2012 to 25p/kWh in 2024, and the 2022 energy crisis causing unprecedented volatility - wholesale gas prices peaked at over £400/MWh, causing household bills to double within months. EPC calculations continue to use standardised prices, meaning the running costs shown on certificates bear little relation to what households actually pay. For homeowners and buyers trying to understand the financial case for energy improvements, the figures are next to useless.

### Heat Loss
The heat loss of a building is the rate at which it loses heat at a given temperature differential. It can be expressed as Watts per degree below a baseline (e.g. 100W/°C), or as a design heat loss (e.g. 5kW) - the power needed to maintain 21°C inside when the outside temperature is at the coldest reasonably expected, typically -2°C to 2°C depending on location.  

Knowing the heat loss of buildings had some value, but ultimately wasn't that important in an age when most buildings were heated with boilers. Most boilers are dramatically oversized for the heat loss of the building, which allows them to rapidly heat them on demand, which in turn allows the central heating to be turned on separately in the morning and evening on a day when all occupants go out during the daytime. To give you a feeling of typical oversizing, a typical gas combi-boiler might have an output of 25KW or so, even though the design heat loss of a typical house might be 5-10KW. 

That said, the power rating of combi boilers is usually set to provide hot water at nearly full flow rate; for instance, a flow of 10l/min heated up from 10°C to 55°C, i.e. ΔT of 45°C, requires about 33kW. Consequently, the majority of home users are now accustomed to appliances with high peak power output which a heat pump is unlikely to match.

However, for heat pumps, and in particular those thinking of installing a heat pump, the design heat loss is incredibly important. It's the single figure that indicates how large the heat pump you might want to install in the house is. It's a pre-requisite for rough installation cost estimate.

## The Home Energy Model: A Long Time Coming

The government is aware that the EPC methodology is broken. In 2021, it appointed a consortium led by BRE - the Building Research Establishment - to develop a replacement called the Home Energy Model (HEM). On paper, HEM addresses many of the criticisms above: half-hourly energy simulation rather than monthly averages, forward-looking carbon intensity factors that reflect the decarbonising grid, and better modelling of heat pumps and smart technologies.

To understand why the project has struggled, it helps to understand who BRE are. Founded in 1921 as a government research laboratory and privatised in 1997, BRE developed the original SAP methodology back in the early 1990s, building on their Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM) from the 1980s. They are a traditional building research establishment - experts in construction materials, fire safety, and building physics - but not a modern software engineering organisation. The original SAP was never designed for the digital age; it was a spreadsheet calculation that happened to get codified.

The contrast with Britain's emerging energy technology sector could not be starker. Octopus Energy's Kraken platform now manages 54 million customer accounts across 17 countries, with continuous deployment pipelines and cloud-native architecture. The platform has been licensed to EDF, E.ON, and other major utilities. Heat Geek, a startup founded in 2022, has already built a digital platform featuring LiDAR-based room scanning, augmented reality heat pump placement, and AI-powered system design - tools that didn't exist when the Home Energy Model project began. These companies ship sophisticated energy software in months, not years.

The HEM project, by contrast, has taken over five years and counting. The reference implementation was quietly published as a Python package on BRE's Azure DevOps - a platform virtually unknown outside enterprise software development circles. For a model that will underpin national building regulations, this obscure location made it remarkably difficult for the energy research community to scrutinise, test, or contribute to the methodology.

Then came the software failures. In early 2024, housebuilders discovered that bugs in how heat pumps were modelled made it impossible to demonstrate compliance with the Future Homes Standard for many common building types. The consultation had to be extended, and industry sources warned that fixing the underlying model could take up to two years.

The government's response was to commission a rewrite of the calculation engine in Rust, a systems programming language prized for its performance. The [Rust implementation](https://github.com/communitiesuk/epb-home-energy-model) can run a calculation in around 5 seconds compared to 5 minutes in Python - a 60-fold improvement. But as of late 2025, the Rust version remains, by its own documentation, "functionally incomplete."

The choice of Rust is itself questionable. Python is the lingua franca of energy modelling - used by academics, grid operators, and the renewable energy industry worldwide. The pool of Rust developers in the buildings and energy sector is vanishingly small. By rewriting in an unfamiliar language, the government has made it harder for the very experts who might spot methodological errors to engage with the code.

More fundamentally, the Rust rewrite foreclosed other approaches to the performance problem. Ironically, the Rust implementation is itself deployed to AWS Lambda - the very serverless environment that could have scaled the original Python code horizontally, running hundreds of calculations concurrently without modifying a single line of code. This approach would have delivered comparable throughput while keeping the codebase accessible to the energy modelling community. Instead, the government chose a path that prioritised raw single-thread performance over transparency and collaboration.

The timeline tells the story: project initiated in 2021, first consultation released November 2023, software failures discovered March 2024, and integration into EPCs now pushed back to "the second half of 2026." Five years to build what is, at its core, a building energy calculation engine - while startups in the same sector ship comparable tools in a fraction of the time.

The election of a Labour government in July 2024 brought renewed interest in energy efficiency policy. Ed Miliband, the new Energy Secretary, reinstated the EPC C target for private rentals that Rishi Sunak had scrapped in September 2023 as part of his "pragmatic" retreat from net zero commitments. The new proposals require all rental properties to reach EPC C by 2030, with new tenancies meeting the standard by 2028. The cost cap for landlord improvements was raised from £3,500 to £15,000, and a £6.6 billion "Warm Homes Plan" was announced to upgrade five million homes with insulation, heat pumps, and solar panels.

But the damage from policy flip-flopping extends far beyond political optics. The retrofit industry - installers, manufacturers, training providers - cannot scale up capacity without confidence that demand will materialise. Landlords who began upgrade work when EPC C by 2025 was the target found themselves in limbo when Sunak scrapped the policy, only to face renewed deadlines under Labour. As one landlord put it: "All this uncertainty has led to good landlords selling up." Research by Hamptons found that at the current rate of energy efficiency improvements, it would take until 2042 for all rental homes to meet standards that are supposedly required by 2030. The estimated £24 billion investment needed for the private rental sector alone will not materialise while policy lurches between governments. Heat pump manufacturers have delayed UK expansion plans; training providers cannot commit to scaling up installer numbers; and householders remain confused about whether and when they need to act. The Clean Heat Market Mechanism, intended to provide "policy confidence to invest in supply chains," was itself delayed - contributing to the very uncertainty it was designed to resolve.

Then, in the November 2025 budget, came another blow: the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) will end in March 2026. ECO had been the primary mechanism for funding energy efficiency improvements in low-income households since 2013, requiring energy suppliers to fund insulation and heating upgrades. Landlords with fuel-poor tenants could access it to help meet efficiency standards. But Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it "a failed scheme" - and the numbers bear this out. ECO cost households £1.7 billion annually through levies on electricity bills, yet a National Audit Office report found that 97% of families in fuel poverty saved less than they were charged. The same report uncovered serious quality failures, with external wall insulation installations flagged as particularly problematic. The scheme meant to help the fuel-poor was, in aggregate, making them worse off - while funding shoddy work.

The Warm Homes Plan is meant to replace ECO, funded through general taxation rather than bill levies. But as of December 2025, the full policy details remain unpublished. Landlords who might have relied on ECO to help fund their tenants' upgrades now face yet another gap - between a scheme that's ending and a replacement that isn't yet defined. The pattern is consistent: targets are set, mechanisms are promised, and the details arrive late or not at all.

But despite the policy ambition, the underlying infrastructure remains stuck. As of December 2025, the Future Homes Standard - originally promised "by the end of 2025" - has slipped again, now expected "in the coming months," likely early 2026. The HEM test version released in August 2025 remains unchanged. The government has approved SAP 10.3 as a fallback methodology for a "dual running period," tacit acknowledgment that HEM still isn't ready for prime time. Meanwhile, a separate consultation on EPC reforms ran from December 2024 to February 2025, proposing to replace the single headline rating with multiple metrics covering fabric performance, heating systems, smart readiness, and energy costs - worthy ideas that won't materialise until the new methodology is actually working.

In theory, landlords can act now. RdSAP 10, introduced in June 2025, updated the methodology for existing homes with more accurate carbon factors. A landlord who obtains an EPC rated C or above under the current system will be considered compliant with the 2028 and 2030 deadlines - the certificate remains valid until it expires. But the goalposts are already moving. When the Home Energy Model arrives in late 2026, ratings are expected to shift, and the government is consulting on reducing EPC validity from ten years to as little as two - meaning a certificate obtained today might expire well before 2030. Landlords face a choice between acting now on a methodology that may soon be superseded, or waiting for clarity that never quite arrives.

Worse still, the current methodology actively penalises the very investments the government wants landlords to make. EPC assessors are familiar with the problem: an air source heat pump can result in a worse rating than a gas boiler in an identical property. RdSAP uses simplified default assumptions that drastically understate heat pump performance - assuming a coefficient of performance as low as 1.7 when real-world systems routinely achieve 3.5 to 4.0. Heat pumps are also penalised for using electricity, which remains more expensive per kilowatt-hour than gas, even though their efficiency means total running costs are often comparable or lower. The Home Energy Model was designed to fix this, using proper manufacturer test data to reflect actual heat pump performance. But every month HEM is delayed, landlords who install heat pumps are stuck with EPC ratings that don't reflect reality - and in some cases, ratings worse than if they had simply kept the gas boiler. The policy is working against itself.

And millions of existing EPCs continue to circulate with ratings calculated under older methodologies. Until the recent RdSAP 10 update, certificates were still being issued using carbon factors that dated from 2012, assuming electricity produced 519g of CO2 per kilowatt-hour - nearly three times the actual grid intensity. Homeowners have been told for years that their heat pump would produce almost as much carbon as a gas boiler, a claim that has been demonstrably false since at least 2020.

## A Market That Can't Retrofit Itself

Beneath the policy dysfunction lies a more fundamental problem: the structure of the UK property market itself. Britain's housing tenure has shifted dramatically over the past four decades in ways that make coordinated energy efficiency investment almost impossible.

Owner occupation peaked at 71% in 2003 and has since declined to around 65%. The private rental sector has doubled since the early 2000s to nearly five million households - one in five homes. Social housing, which once accounted for over 30% of the stock in the early 1980s, has shrunk to just 16% following decades of Right to Buy sales and chronic underinvestment in new council housing.

This matters for retrofit because each tenure type faces different barriers - and the tenures best suited to coordinated investment have shrunk while the most difficult ones have grown.

The private rental sector is extraordinarily fragmented. According to the English Private Landlord Survey, 88% of landlords own fewer than ten properties, and these small-scale landlords account for 63% of all private tenancies. Most are not professional property managers; rental income is a sideline, not a primary occupation. They lack the cash reserves for major capital improvements, struggle to access finance on commercial terms, and are difficult for government policy to reach. The sector accounts for one in five UK households but only 11% of domestic heat pump installations - a disparity explained largely by the "split incentive" problem, where landlords bear the upfront cost of improvements while tenants reap the benefit of lower bills.

Tax policy has made things worse. Section 24 of the Finance Act 2015, introduced by George Osborne and fully phased in by 2020, removed the ability of individual landlords to deduct mortgage interest from their rental income before calculating tax. Instead, they receive only a 20% basic rate tax credit - regardless of their actual tax band. For a higher-rate taxpayer, this represents a 33% increase in the effective cost of borrowing; for additional-rate taxpayers, closer to 45%. When Section 24 was first announced, buy-to-let mortgage rates were around 2-3%, and the impact - while significant - was manageable for many landlords. But interest rates have since risen sharply: by late 2023, average buy-to-let rates exceeded 6%, and even after recent Bank of England cuts they remain around 5%. A 33% increase in the effective cost of finance hurts considerably more when the underlying rate is 5% than when it is 2%. For a landlord considering a £10,000-15,000 retrofit investment on a modestly yielding property, the combination of higher base rates and restricted tax relief can materially erode the financial case for improvement - particularly when the benefits flow primarily to tenants through lower energy bills rather than to the landlord through higher rents.

The policy was intended to cool an overheated buy-to-let market, but its interaction with retrofit incentives was not considered. The number of landlords incorporating into limited companies - which can still deduct mortgage interest in full - has risen 332% since 2016, but incorporation is complex and expensive, putting it out of reach for the small-scale landlords who dominate the sector.

The current government shows little sign of reconsidering this approach. In the run-up to the November 2025 budget, the Treasury actively considered extending National Insurance to rental income - a move that would have more than doubled tax bills for many landlords. In the event, Rachel Reeves stopped short of introducing NI on rents, but did increase tax rates on property income by 2 percentage points, and made clear her view that it is "not fair" that rental income escapes National Insurance while employment income does not. The direction of travel is clear: landlords will pay more tax, not less. Yet if the government is determined to extract more from the private rental sector, it could at least consider allowing enhanced deductions for retrofit investment - improvements that directly reduce tenants' energy bills, cut carbon emissions, and contribute to national energy security. Instead, the tax system treats a landlord who installs a heat pump identically to one who does nothing, while simultaneously demanding that both reach EPC C by 2030.

Leasehold properties face even more intractable barriers. In a typical block of flats, the freeholder controls the building fabric and common areas but has no financial incentive to invest in energy upgrades - ground rents are fixed, and the freeholder doesn't pay the energy bills. Leaseholders, meanwhile, cannot make improvements to shared structures without the freeholder's consent, which is rarely forthcoming. Research by Oxford University found that the only way energy upgrades in communal areas can proceed is through unanimous agreement between freeholder and all leaseholders - an agreement that must be reached outside the terms of the lease, since most leases contain no mechanism for recovering improvement costs. In practice, this means that millions of flats in England and Wales are effectively locked out of retrofit regardless of what their EPCs say or what targets the government sets.

Social housing, by contrast, offers the potential for coordinated, estate-wide retrofit programmes managed by professional landlords with long-term investment horizons. But decades of Right to Buy have sold off the best stock to private owners, and the sector is now too small to drive the market transformation that retrofit requires. The housing associations and local authorities that remain are themselves financially stretched, dependent on uncertain government funding streams that come and go with political cycles.

The result is a housing market where the tenures most amenable to efficient retrofit have shrunk, while the most fragmented and misaligned tenures have grown. No amount of EPC targets or methodology reform can fix a market where the people who own buildings have no incentive to improve them, and the people who live in them have no power to do so.

## Could the Private Sector Come to the Rescue?

If government cannot deliver the infrastructure, perhaps the private sector can route around it. Several innovations suggest alternative paths forward - though each comes with its own limitations.

**Property passports and digital building records** have been discussed for over two decades. The idea is simple: create a persistent digital record for each building that accumulates information over time - construction details, retrofit history, actual energy consumption, maintenance records - following the property through successive owners and tenants. UCL's Building Stock Lab has developed a 3DStock platform representing every building in the country in full 3D geometry with energy characteristics attached. The Green Finance Institute has published proposals for Building Renovation Passports that would give homeowners a tailored roadmap for retrofit. Yet as of late 2023, only around 450,000 digital building logbooks existed across the UK - a tiny fraction of the 29 million homes that need attention. The National Retrofit Hub has convened a working group to develop standards, but progress remains slow.

**Energy bill transparency** could transform the market overnight. EPCs tell you what a building *should* consume based on theoretical models; actual energy bills tell you what it *does* consume. Display Energy Certificates, mandatory for large public buildings, already show real consumption data - but there is no equivalent requirement for homes. If actual energy consumption were disclosed at point of sale or rental, buyers and tenants could see immediately what they would pay to heat and power the property. This would reward genuinely efficient homes and expose poor performers, regardless of their EPC rating. The data exists - smart meters capture it in real time - but privacy concerns and lack of regulatory will have kept it siloed.

**Energy-as-a-service models** offer a way to sidestep the capital barrier entirely. Kensa, a ground source heat pump manufacturer backed by Legal & General and Octopus Energy, has pioneered a "heat as a service" approach for social housing. Rather than asking residents to fund a heat pump upfront, Kensa installs networked ground source systems and charges a monthly standing fee - much like the old gas grid model. Residents in their "Heat the Streets" pilot in Cornwall pay around £130 per month for heating, often saving money compared to their previous gas or oil systems. The upfront cost is borne by the utility or housing provider, not the occupant.

Solar subscriptions offer a similar model for generation. Sunsave, which secured £113 million in funding in 2025, offers a monthly subscription that covers installation of solar panels and batteries with no upfront payment. Unlike the predatory "rent-a-roof" schemes of the 2010s - which locked homeowners into 25-year leases and retained ownership of the panels - newer subscription models let customers own the system from day one while spreading the cost. The government is even exploring allowing tenants to install portable plug-in solar panels on balconies, as is already common in Germany.

These models are promising, but they remain marginal. Kensa has installed around 16,000 heat pumps in its 25-year history - impressive for a pioneer, but a rounding error against the 19 million homes below EPC C. Sunsave's £113 million facility might serve "tens of thousands" of homes; the UK has 29 million. Private innovation can demonstrate what is possible, but it cannot substitute for the scale that only coordinated policy - or a functional EPC system - could deliver.

## Conclusion

Energy Performance Certificates were meant to be a simple tool: give buildings a rating, let the market do the rest. Two decades on, the system has comprehensively failed to deliver.

The ratings themselves are unreliable, varying between assessors and over time for the same property. For years the methodology used carbon factors so outdated that heat pumps appeared almost as polluting as gas boilers. Key information that homeowners actually need - heat loss figures, realistic running costs - is calculated but not shown. The replacement methodology has been in development for five years and still isn't ready, while startups in the same sector ship comparable tools in months. Policy has lurched between governments, with targets set, scrapped, and reinstated, leaving the retrofit industry unable to scale and landlords unsure whether to act. The main funding mechanism for low-income households was revealed to be making the fuel-poor worse off. And beneath all of this lies a property market structurally hostile to coordinated investment: fragmented private landlords with no incentive to improve, leaseholders locked out by absent freeholders, and a social housing sector too depleted to lead.

The government continues to set ambitious targets - EPC C by 2028 for new tenancies, 2030 for all rentals - while the infrastructure to measure, fund, and deliver those improvements remains broken or absent. The policy is working against itself: demanding investment while penalising it through the tax system, promoting heat pumps while using a methodology that undervalues them, setting deadlines while the tools to meet them remain incomplete.

Fixing this will require more than a new calculation engine. It will require stable, long-term policy that gives industry confidence to invest. It will require funding mechanisms that actually reach the households that need them. It will require tax incentives aligned with climate goals rather than working against them. And it will require confronting the structural barriers in the housing market itself - the split incentives, the leasehold dysfunction, the fragmentation - that no amount of certification can overcome.

Until then, Energy Performance Certificates will remain what they have always been: a bureaucratic exercise that tells homeowners little they can trust, and does even less to make buildings better.
