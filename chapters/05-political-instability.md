# Chapter 5: Political Instability - Nuclear Flip-Flopping and Policy Chaos

France and Britain's energy policies were remarkably similar until the 1970s. Both countries had nationalised their electricity industries after World War II, both relied heavily on coal for power generation, and both were developing civilian nuclear programs. But when the 1973 oil crisis hit, their responses couldn't have been more different. France launched the ambitious Messmer Plan - a massive state-driven program to shift almost entirely to nuclear power. Meanwhile, Britain's response was characteristically muddled.

What makes Britain's failure even more striking is that it started with a clear lead. The UK connected the world's first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, to the grid in 1956; by the early 1960s it had a fleet of Magnox reactors in operation and was exporting nuclear expertise to countries like Italy and Japan.

France, by contrast, lagged the UK through the 1960s and only leapt ahead after decisively standardising on pressurised water reactors (PWRs) in the 1970s. Britain stuck with a sequence of bespoke designs (Magnox → Advanced Gas‑cooled Reactor → the never‑completed Fast Breeder → belated PWRs), each change resetting learning curves, complicating procurement, and delaying delivery.

The discovery of North Sea oil and gas in the late 1960s had already complicated Britain's energy planning. Should the country double down on nuclear power like France? Or rely on this new domestic fossil fuel bounty? The result was policy paralysis. While France built 56 nuclear reactors in just 15 years, Britain's nuclear program became mired in debates about reactor designs, locations, and costs. The contrast in outcomes is stark: today nuclear provides over 70% of France's electricity at some of the lowest prices in Europe, while Britain's aging nuclear fleet supplies just 15%, is owned by the French state supplier EdF and is mostly due for retirement.

That said, the French approach isn't without long term challenges of its own. Having built so many nuclear reactors so quickly, the French grid effectively became saturated with nuclear energy. To find markets, France had to expand interconnector cables with each of its x continental neighbours and Britain. When the saturation occured in the 1980s and 1990s, France also had to stop building new nuclear reactors. The massive, geographically mobile workforce and domestic supply chain which had grown up around the nationwide attempt that built 56 nuclear reactors in 15 years started to disentegrate. Talented workers went elsewhere or retired. Intermediate suppliers ramped down production facilities. In the years between 2022 when Civaux was finished and 2024 when Flamanville C was finished France didn't open a single new nuclear reactor. This important point is often ignored in British discourse comparing energy policy on either side of the channel. However, with x nuclear reactors representing X GW of capacity expected to retire in the 2030s, x GW in the 2040s and x GW in the 2050s, France now faces a cliff edge. Life extensions to nuclear plants are commonplace and substantial extensions are expected, inevitable and unlikely controversial for safety. However, the technology which was supposed to epitomise stability and self-sufficiency in energy production had instead created a multi-generational boom-bust cycle.

Financially, the French approach is also laying the foundations for longer term challenges. The investment in nuclear energy assumed a 0% discount rate. Given the vast upfront and decomissioning costs of nuclear power, there is a huge financial burden on future generations of decommissioning and containing the nuclear waste. It's quite difficult to measure the lifetime (or lifecycle) cost of nuclear in terms that you can compare to gas or other energy technologies. However, the best estimates suggest that the lifetime levelised cost (similar to an NPV or net present value) per megawatt hour of French nuclear power is about x EUR/MWh. This is similar to the cost of gas fired electricity at x EUR/MWh. 

The main advantage of the French approach is stability. When wholesale energy prices spiked in 2022, France should at least in theory have been well placed to ride out the period of high prices. The cost of nuclear power generation in the short-run is relatively low, nuclear fuel costs only about x / MWh generated compared with about x / MWh for gas at current prices. The value of nuclear exports should have massively boosted France's balance of trade and the trading results of its state-owned electricity generator, EdF. And even if energy prices in France were allowed to rise, to respect the country's commitments to the EU single energy market, there would be considerable tax revenue from France's energy companies, most siginificantly EdF to offset the cost of any state support afforded to households and businesses. 

However, as it turns out, France didn't see such a windfall in 2022 for a number of reasons:

**Nuclear Fault** - In 2022, France's nuclear fleet was operating at just 60% capacity due to widespread corrosion issues discovered in key reactor components. This forced the shutdown of 32 reactors for safety inspections and repairs, dramatically reducing France's nuclear output and export potential.

**Hydro Drought** - France's second-largest electricity source, hydroelectric power, was severely affected by drought conditions across Europe. Reservoir levels fell to historic lows, cutting hydro generation by 40% compared to normal years and forcing France to import electricity rather than export it. 

The combination of these two crises meant that France, normally Europe's largest electricity exporter, became a net importer for the first time in decades. France imported 16 TWh of electricity in 2022 - equivalent to the annual consumption of 4 million households. This reversal from France's typical 50 TWh annual exports contributed significantly to Europe's energy shortage during the Ukraine crisis, pushing wholesale electricity prices to €400/MWh in August 2022 - ten times the pre-crisis average. For context, France's annual electricity consumption is around 450 TWh, in Britain it is 300 TWh. France's sudden need for gas-fired power from neighbouring countries like Britain, Italy and the Netherlands had a particularly marked effect on prices. This demand brought less efficient, peaking gas power stations into operation, which due to marginal pricing forced up the cost of power from all other sources, including more efficient gas plants and renewable technologies.
