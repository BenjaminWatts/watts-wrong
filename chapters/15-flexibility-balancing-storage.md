# Chapter 15: Flexibility, Balancing and Storage - The Grid's Hidden Challenges

## Why Timing Matters: The 9-5 Problem

If you ask a typical well-informed Brit when the electricity grid feels the most strain, chances are they'll respond with the old story about balancing the spike in kettle use that happens during must-watch TV events and especially knock-out Euros and World Cup England football matches. While it's a memorable story that explains the need for hydro pumped storage (and these days, batteries) on the grid quite poignantly, it's never really been true.

The reality is rather less charming. Much of the electricity spike comes from fridge compressors in pubs and homes as spectators grab cold drinks during the match. And yes, there's also a surge from water companies as everyone rushes to the toilet during half-time, forcing pumping stations to work overtime to refill cisterns. Neither of these explanations has quite the same romantic appeal as the tea-making story, so it's no wonder the kettle myth persists - it's much more British.

The bigger explanation as to why this isn't true however is that major England football matches, which in the age of Netflix are about the last remaining collective live TV event, are at the wrong time of year and day. The grid is never under much strain at 8-9pm on a summer evening, when the World Cup or Euros matches are typically held. Instead, the reality of when the grid is under most strain is far more mundane, but predictable, and it is between 4pm and 7pm on winter weekday evenings and during school term times. There are a number of complementary reasons for high demand:

1. It gets dark from 3pm onwards, especially in mid winter, further north and on overcast days. This drives a need for lighting both in buildings and on streets that doesn't exist to the same degree in the rest of the year. And while the development of LED lighting has dramatically cut the use of electricity in this space, lighting remains a significant contributor to UK electricity demand during winter months.

2. It's colder in winter, which created greater demands for heating.

3. Families begin the preparation of evening meals, especially those with younger children. Cooking appliances use lots of electricity, especially ovens!

4. The end of the school working day at 3-4pm and office working day at 5pm creates a particular spike in home heating demand as thermostats warm-up homes in preparation for people arriving home.

5. The mismatch of the end of the school working day (3-4pm) and office working day (5pm) creates an overlap period from 4 to 5:30pm when most offices are still open and using electricity for computers, lighting or machinery, but many households and especially those with children are at home and using appliances there e.g. for cooking. This coincidence, the use of electricity in both sets of locations at once, albeit only for a relatively short period of time, is what drives the need for a lot of the investment in our energy system and the costs we see on our bills.

There are laudable attempts by suppliers to discourage use of electricity in peak periods. Smart tariffs reward customers for this and this is possible because the suppliers can avoid more expensive wholesale energy prices in the peak hours, when the least efficient power stations and batteries are needed to meet demand, as well as punitive charges from the electricity networks. Over time, automation and remote control of home batteries, heat pumps and EVs is likely to extend this sort of demand response much further and without any conscious behaviour from end users. Indeed, given the spike in electricity demand over the 4-7pm period is often only 5-8 GW, it would only take around 2-3 million homes installing a standard 3kW battery to completely eliminate this peak. That said, as we use more power and especially power from renewables, the goal posts may shift higher further into the future.

It begs the question of whether a more root-and-branch review of how we structure our working day might be called for. The norms we have - such as the 9-5 working day for adults and 13 weeks of school holidays per year - are a legacy of Victorian industrial practices, for example when children were needed to gather summer harvest crops. Recent evidence has called into question the productivity of knowledge-focused work in particular, with research suggesting that an 8-hour working day may not be optimal for cognitive tasks. Closing offices earlier would significantly reduce electricity demand during peak periods, allow working parents to more easily collect children from school, and bring substantive improvements to mental health and road safety (fewer journeys completed in the dark).

Another aspect of why our current working day adds so much to energy bills is that we only really put significant pressure on the energy system for a relatively short period of time. So the fixed cost of maintaining an energy system capable of meeting these peak demands is spread over a relatively limited number of hours and days. The main winter season lasts from early November (just after the clocks go back) to late February. During this period, there is much less pressure on the grid on weekend evenings (which account for 2 out of 7 days). There is also significantly less pressure on Friday evenings, as people are more likely to head out straight from the office, eat later, or dine out. This pattern is further interrupted by the Christmas fortnight and, to some extent, the February half-term week, which also sometimes falls in a different week around the country. And from the start of March, even if the weather isn't much warmer, the lighter evenings are enough to cut the use of much lighting. Putting all this together, there are only really around 70 potential evenings - Monday to Thursdays between November and February. And if the weather is particularly mild and windy, which with climate change it often is, this can further reduce the strain on the grid as heating demand is lower and there is abundant wind generation on the grid. In many winters, we might realistically only face 20 evenings when we put much strain on the grid.

However, adopting a model where we require dynamic behaviour change in response to strains on the grid has risks. It is likely to be inherently disruptive, like the overnight routine changes faced by many families during COVID. The alternative - blackouts - are vastly more disruptive, so it would always be worth even very drastic action to avoid this eventuality. But even with automated solutions like smart batteries and EVs, there's still a strong case for a more joined-up approach that considers broader social, education, and health policy. The 9-5 working day and school hours that create our peak energy demand aren't just energy policy issues - they affect family life, mental health, road safety, and educational outcomes. A coordinated approach that addresses these multiple benefits could be more effective than relying solely on technological fixes. Moreover, making an overall and permanent change - such as shifting typical working hours earlier - would be more predictable for both the energy system and for families, rather than requiring constant adaptation to grid conditions.

## The Technical Challenge: Grid Flexibility

Britain's electricity grid faces a fundamental challenge that has grown dramatically in recent years: the need for flexibility to balance supply and demand in real-time. As we've increased our reliance on intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar, the traditional model of matching generation to demand has become increasingly complex and expensive.

## The Balancing Challenge

Electricity cannot be stored easily at grid scale, meaning supply and demand must be balanced second-by-second. This balancing act has become significantly more challenging as our energy mix has shifted from predictable fossil fuel plants to variable renewable sources.

### The Scale of the Problem

In 2024, wind and solar now provide over 40% of Britain's electricity, up from less than 10% in 2010. This transformation has created new challenges:

- **Wind variability**: Wind output can vary from near-zero to full capacity within hours
- **Solar intermittency**: Solar generation drops to zero every evening and is reduced on cloudy days
- **Demand patterns**: Peak demand still occurs on winter evenings when renewable generation is typically low

The result is a system that requires far more sophisticated balancing mechanisms than the simple "turn up the gas" approach that worked when fossil fuels dominated.

## Current Balancing Mechanisms

Britain's electricity system uses several mechanisms to maintain balance:

### 1. The Balancing Mechanism
National Grid ESO operates the Balancing Mechanism, where generators and demand-side response providers can offer to increase or decrease output to help balance the system. This operates in real-time, with offers typically made 1-4 hours ahead.

### 2. Frequency Response Services
These services respond automatically to frequency changes on the grid:
- **Primary Response**: Automatic response within 10 seconds
- **Secondary Response**: Automatic response within 30 seconds  
- **High Frequency Response**: For when generation exceeds demand

### 3. Reserve Services
- **Short-term Operating Reserve (STOR)**: Gas and diesel plants that can start within 20 minutes
- **Dynamic Containment**: Fast-acting batteries and other technologies responding within 1 second

## The Cost of Flexibility

The increasing need for flexibility has created a significant new cost category in the electricity system. In 2023, balancing costs reached over £2 billion annually, up from around £200 million a decade ago. These costs are passed through to consumers via network charges.

### Why Costs Are Rising

1. **Reduced inertia**: Traditional thermal plants provide system inertia naturally. As these close, we need to pay for synthetic inertia from batteries and other technologies.

2. **More volatile prices**: With intermittent renewables, electricity prices can swing from negative (when wind is high and demand low) to over £1,000/MWh (when demand is high and wind is low).

3. **Backup capacity**: We still need enough dispatchable capacity to meet demand when renewables aren't available, but this capacity earns less revenue when renewables are generating.

## Storage Technologies

### Battery Storage
Battery storage has emerged as a key technology for providing flexibility:
- **Grid-scale batteries**: Large installations providing balancing services
- **Behind-the-meter storage**: Household and commercial batteries
- **Electric vehicles**: Mobile storage that can provide vehicle-to-grid services

The cost of battery storage has fallen dramatically, from over $1,000/kWh in 2010 to under $200/kWh in 2024, making it increasingly competitive.

### Pumped Hydro Storage
Britain has four major pumped hydro facilities:
- Dinorwig (1,728 MW)
- Ffestiniog (360 MW)  
- Cruachan (440 MW)
- Foyers (300 MW)

These provide valuable storage capacity but are limited by geography and environmental constraints.

### Hydrogen Storage
Hydrogen is being explored as a long-duration storage solution:
- **Electrolysis**: Using surplus renewable electricity to produce hydrogen
- **Storage**: Storing hydrogen in salt caverns or other geological formations
- **Power generation**: Using hydrogen in gas turbines or fuel cells when needed

However, the round-trip efficiency is currently only around 35-40%, making it expensive compared to batteries for short-duration storage.

## Demand-Side Response

Rather than just building more generation capacity, we can also manage demand to help balance the system:

### Time-of-Use Tariffs
Smart tariffs that charge different rates at different times can encourage consumers to shift their electricity use away from peak periods.

### Smart Appliances
Heat pumps, electric vehicles, and other appliances can be programmed to respond to grid signals, adjusting their operation to help balance supply and demand.

### Industrial Demand Response
Large industrial users can reduce their demand during peak periods in exchange for payments from the system operator.

## The Future of Flexibility

### Smart Grid Technologies
The development of a truly smart grid will enable more sophisticated balancing:
- **Real-time monitoring**: Sensors throughout the system providing instant data
- **Automated response**: Smart devices automatically adjusting to grid conditions
- **Predictive analytics**: AI and machine learning to forecast and manage variability

### Market Reforms
Current electricity markets were designed for a system dominated by large, predictable generators. Reforms are needed to:
- **Value flexibility**: Properly price the services that help balance the system
- **Enable new technologies**: Remove barriers for batteries, demand response, and other flexible resources
- **Coordinate planning**: Better integration between transmission, distribution, and generation planning

### Distributed Energy Resources
The future grid will likely see much more distributed generation and storage:
- **Rooftop solar**: Combined with household batteries
- **Electric vehicles**: Acting as mobile storage units
- **Community energy**: Local generation and storage projects

## Policy Implications

The need for flexibility has significant policy implications:

### 1. Market Design
Current markets don't properly value flexibility services. We need reforms to ensure that:
- Providers of flexibility are properly compensated
- New technologies can compete fairly with traditional solutions
- Markets work efficiently across different timescales (seconds to seasons)

### 2. Network Planning
Network planning needs to account for the increasing importance of flexibility:
- **Transmission**: Better connections between regions to share flexibility resources
- **Distribution**: Smart networks that can manage bidirectional power flows
- **Storage**: Strategic placement of storage to maximize system benefits

### 3. Consumer Protection
As flexibility becomes more important, we need to ensure consumers are protected:
- **Fair access**: All consumers should benefit from flexibility markets
- **Transparency**: Clear information about how flexibility costs are allocated
- **Reliability**: Maintaining supply security as the system becomes more complex

## The Economic Case for Flexibility

Investing in flexibility makes economic sense:
- **Avoiding infrastructure**: Flexibility can defer or avoid expensive grid upgrades
- **Reducing waste**: Better balancing reduces the need to curtail renewable generation
- **Lower costs**: More efficient markets should reduce overall system costs

However, the benefits need to be properly captured and distributed. Current market arrangements often don't reflect the full value of flexibility services.

## Conclusion

Flexibility, balancing, and storage represent some of the most important challenges facing Britain's electricity system. As we continue to decarbonize, these issues will become more critical, not less. Success will require:

- **Technology innovation**: Continued development of storage and smart grid technologies
- **Market reform**: Properly valuing and compensating flexibility services  
- **Policy coordination**: Ensuring that market design, network planning, and regulation work together
- **Consumer engagement**: Helping consumers understand and benefit from the transition

The alternative - a system that can't properly balance supply and demand - would mean either:
- **Higher costs**: From inefficient operation and excessive backup capacity
- **Lower reliability**: From inadequate balancing mechanisms
- **Slower decarbonization**: From inability to integrate more renewable generation

Getting flexibility right is essential for delivering a clean, reliable, and affordable electricity system.
