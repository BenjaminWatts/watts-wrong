# Chapter 7: Scotland - The North-South Divide

If you start studying or working in the British energy market today, there's little to formally distinguish the energy system in Scotland from the rest of England and Wales. It's part of the same wholesale market, retail consumers north and south of the border choose between the same suppliers. Regulation on competition is identical. And while the Scottish Government is devolved some powers in the energy space, which it has used to permit more onshore wind development and offer more generous support for heatpumps and insulation over the years compared with Westminster administrations, this understanding misses key historical aspects.

History lessons can often be a bit boring, and many younger readers may be questioning why reading about what went on in the 1980s and 1990s might seem irrelevant. But we need to set the scene: Scotland and the Highlands in particular are absolutely front and center of the decarbonisation strategy that the UK is taking. The central challenge of our electricity system over the next 10-20 years is to deliver ever increasing, affordable and reliable supplies of wind energy, managed intelligently and flexibly with modern technology from north to south. Understanding why this is such a challenge requires going back to how the system was originally designed, and what the institutional and political frictions are as well as those of physical geography.

In England, the electricity grid started as private (or municipal) undertakings in major cities in the late 19th century, with coal power stations build to serve nearby factories and housing. The first National Grid wasn't built until the 1920s/30s. Even then, it didn't extend north of central Scotland (Glasgow and Edinburgh). Electricity in the north of Scotland followed later, and focussed more at localised hydro schemes, where the region's unique geography and population density compared to the rest of the country created a radically different grid setup. However, after 1945 the electricity systems were largely separated and given different structures. In England, all the power stations (generators) were grouped together with the tranmission grid, with separate regional electricity companies doing the local distribution and retail to end consumers. In Scotland, two vertically integrated companies were created to cover north and south Scotland, both spanning everything from generating power to retail. There was a small amount of capacity between Central Scotland and Northern England to move electricity north or south, but these links were not radically expanded over the decades even as electricity usage grew.

Fast forwarding to the privatisation of the 1990s, and the model adopted reflected the setup in England and Wales, rather than Scotland. Whereas in England there had long been a distinction between the transmission grid (which became National Grid) and siloed regional distribution grids, in Scotland such barriers were less distinct. In very rural areas, it didn't make sense to have distinct organisations strictly focussed at different voltage levels because the distances between settlements were so great and the population density so low that maintaining separate transmission and distribution networks would have been economically inefficient. Scotland was also more self-sufficient and contained, it wasn't as important to the national generation strategy. It would have been considered quite strange to try and transmit large amounts of electricity from the Highlands all the way to the south of England when there was so much coal generation capacity already located in the industrial heartlands of the Midlands and South.

# Forcing Retail Competition on Scotland

The vertically integrated Scottish electricity companies had powerful brands. Not only did they generation and transmit/distribute electricity, but in rural areas without gas supplies, storage heaters were supplied and maintained by the electricity companies with special tariffs and widespread use of remote controlled charging. The Scottish electricity companies also had powerful retail brands, with high street shops and a local (nationalist) identity. Even British Gas identifies itself as Scottish gas north of the border. Even when customers were allowed to chose a supplier in Scotland after 1998, far fewer chose to switch than in England. And companies with origins south of the border found it much harder to win customers in Scotland.

# Merging wholesale markets

For 15 years after initial privatisations, Scotland remained outside the wholesale market for England and Wales. It only fully joined in 2005, 15 years later than the rest of England and Wales. The Scottish market remained dominated by the two vertically integrated electricity companies and wholesale prices were regulated. In a market as small as Scotland, it was deemed there simply wasn't enough competition to rely on a free market to set prices, and there wasn't enough transmission capacity with England to be part of that much larger market.

Prices in Scotland remained a higher, despite which Scotland never saw the same "dash for gas" that took hold south of the border, in part because without a liquid private market, it was more difficult for developers to privately finance such developments. Over time, it became clear the same impediment would limit the development of Scotland's increasingly abundant wind resources, which needed access to markets south of the border.

# Marriage of mutual convenience

Now fully part, at least financially of the GB power market, investment in power generation in Scotland has boomed in the last 20 years. The two major renewables support schemes (ROCs and CfDs) collect revenues a bit like taxes but instead as levies on electricity bills across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The legal guarantee of these subsidies or support is the key to unlocking private finance that then pays the substantial upfront cost of building the windfarms (and the associated grid infrastructure). Given the focus on wind energy within the renewables push, even back in 2010 it was obvious that Scotland was always going to punch above its weight in the national generation mix. After all, Scotland only has about 10% of the UK's population. However, particularly with the [onshore wind ban in England](04-nimbys-wind-ban.md) in 2015, this only accelerated Scotland's role as Britain's renewable energy powerhouse.

This has created a situation where Scotland receives substantial renewable energy investment financed by British electricity consumers, while the economic benefits - jobs, business rates, infrastructure investment, and community development - are concentrated in Scottish communities. The onshore wind ban in England has effectively made Scotland the primary beneficiary of Britain's renewable energy push.

What has emerged is an asymmetric relationship. Scottish renewables projects are financed through levies on electricity bills across Great Britain, meaning Scottish consumers do contribute to the costs - but with Scotland representing only about 10% of Britain's population, their contribution is proportionally much smaller than the benefits they receive. Scotland gets the lion's share of investment in new infrastructure, jobs, tax revenues, and substantial business rates from renewable energy projects. For example, Highland Council alone receives over £20 million annually in business rates from renewable energy projects, with some individual wind farms contributing £500,000-£1 million each year to local council coffers. With a population of just over 235,000 people, this represents around £85 per person annually in additional council revenue from renewable energy - a significant boost for one of Britain's most sparsely populated and economically challenged regions.

It's a bit like all British billpayers (including Scots) agreeing to a debt repayment surcharge on their electricity bills to concentrate energy infrastructure projects in Scotland. While Scottish consumers pay the same levies as everyone else, they represent only about 10% of the total contributions but receive a much larger share of the local economic benefits. The costs are spread across 67 million people, but the local economic benefits - the new infrastructure, the jobs, the business rates, the economic development - are concentrated in areas with just a fraction of that population.

However, the size and scale of the investment would likely not have been possible in a country the size of Scotland on its own. Having access to the capital markets of the City of London and sterling currency are equally essential to Scotland's renewable energy boom. Had Scotland (as it nearly did) voted for independence in 2014, or during a later schism post-Brexit, unpicking the long-term contracts and arrangements in the electricity infrastructure would have been one of many thorny issues that would have had to have been negotiated. The complex web of CfD contracts, transmission agreements, and cross-border electricity trading arrangements would have created a legal and financial nightmare for both sides.

In addition to pushing the investment north, this concentration also requires more infrastructure to bring the energy 500 miles south to where most of the demand is located. This in turn adds costs and complexity to the grid, increases transmission losses, and creates more political tension from NIMBY opposition to new pylons and transmission lines. The very communities that rejected local wind farms are now being asked to accept massive new transmission infrastructure to bring Scottish wind power to southern markets.

Transmission losses over such distances are significant - typically 2-3% per 100 miles for high-voltage AC transmission, meaning 10-15% of the energy generated in Scotland is lost before it reaches southern markets. Even with modern high-voltage DC transmission used on undersea bootstrap cables (which has lower losses of around 1-2% per 100 miles), the 500-mile journey from the Highlands to London still results in 5-10% energy losses. These losses represent not just wasted energy, but also increased costs that are ultimately borne by all British electricity consumers.

Such a dynamic was always going to happen to some extent between urban and rural areas - cities need energy but can't host large-scale renewable projects, while rural areas have the space and resources but limited local demand. However, the onshore wind ban in England has exacerbated this natural tension by forcing a significant portion of the development into Scotland rather than allowing for a more balanced distribution across Britain's rural areas.

This highlights a fundamental tension in Britain's energy system that was recently exposed by the rejected consideration of zonal electricity pricing. The proposal would have created different electricity prices in different regions based on local supply and demand, which would have made electricity cheaper in Scotland (where there's abundant wind generation) and more expensive in southern England (where there's high demand but limited local generation). The rejection of this proposal shows how politically difficult it is to address the geographic imbalances that the current subsidy system has created - where Scottish communities benefit from renewable energy development while English and Welsh consumers pay the bills, but any attempt to reflect these real costs and benefits in pricing is politically unpalatable.
 
# Fastforward to 2025

Taking its history into context, the challenges of making Scotland the center piece or mecca of our energy system today, as we are trying to make it, are enormous. Political history lessons can be boring and sometimes seem a bit irrelevant, but it's quite important to understand just how much of a challenge or strain we're putting on infrastructure and organisational arrangements that simply weren't set up for the top-heavy, wind generation-focused system in the north of Scotland that we are hoping to now get from our electricity system.

Until quite recently, the Highlands and Scotland were basically a backwater - or a sideshow that was never conceived of or properly integrated into Britain's main electricity and energy system. The grid was designed around serving the industrial heartlands of England, with Scotland's hydro schemes and later nuclear plants providing supplementary generation rather than being central to the national strategy. The idea that Scotland would become the powerhouse of Britain's renewable energy system would have seemed absurd to the engineers and planners who built the original grid infrastructure.

Getting electricity from the Highlands to Southern England is, a bit like the equivalent road/rail journey, a tortuous process from the perspective of both physical and institutional geography. It requires transmitting electricity through assets owned three different transmission companies (SSE, Scottish Power, and National Grid). Indeed, if the generation project is connected at lower voltage, it may also involve the entirely (separate) distribution part of SSE. That's a large number of stakeholders, each of which has to be separately managed and regulated. Each of these companies has different perspectives, cultures, and financial objectives. If an investment fails to work out, it's much harder to hold any particular organisation accountable. Indeed, it's arguably simpler to bring power from the near continent (France, Belgium, Netherlands) to the South East of England, and when you look at the flows this is exactly what happens much of the time.

This fragmentation raises the question of whether Britain might need to consider merging or reorganising its grid further - beyond the National System Operator that the government recently created. While the NESO was a step toward better coordination, the fundamental problem of multiple transmission companies with different objectives and regulatory frameworks remains. A truly unified transmission system might be necessary to efficiently manage the north-south flows that Scotland's renewable energy boom requires.
