# Chapter 19: Interest Rates

I learnt early in my career that the single most important figure in short term electricity markets is the gas price. In long-term electricity markets, the equivalent metric is the interest rate.

Starting my career in 2011 and despite having studied economics I have to admit that I didn't realise until really quite recently quite how profound the effect of near zero interest rates was over the 2010 decade. And while many people have learnt the hard way how its unravelling the rise in interest rates post 2021 has changed the world of property, business and vehicle finance, It couldn't have happened at a more prescient and disruptive time for the Energy sector.

in Economics you learn that the interest rate is the connection or the price between now and the future. High interest rates mean that investors require a greater return on the capital in order to be better off than simply putting the money in a bank account or low risk investment like government bonds. 


## Fossil versus Low Carbon

the biggest Divide between fossil fuels and the appliances we used them in and low carbon technologies brackets including renewables is the amount of extra upfront investment You need if you want to pursue the low carbon option. This paradigm holds true in all different levels and sectors of the energy system:

###Gas Power versus Nuclear/Wind
The upfront cost of the state of the art CCGT gas power station is around X pounds per kilowatt. The equivalent figure for a nuclear plant like Hinckley point is X pounds per kilowatt. For an offshore wind farm it's around £6 per kilowatt. However, when it comes to the running costs or marginal costs of these technologies, the pattern reverses. Wind farms don't require fuel. Nuclear fuel is usually under £10 per hour of power generated. Gas power even at today's relatively low prices costs upwards of X pounds per mega Watertower, Given CCG's are at best 55% efficient and power stations, face carbon taxes as well.

###Energy Networks
Separate from the cost of generating electricity, There are profound differences in the cost of the network and infrastructure needed to support a renewables Oriented grid. Wind and Solar are less dense in terms of their footprint on the ground than traditional large scale power stations. They they also tend to be much further from natural centres of demand in big cities, Partly because Land prices are higher around cities and partly because the windiest places tend to be quite remote isolated and either high up offshore or coastal. An access factor in the UK is the role of NIMBYs in deterring many renewable projects from less isolated parts of England. 

Either way, #1 ends up needing more miles of electricity cables pylons substations to run the grid from renewables than one word from traditional fossil fuels. And the cost of building this infrastructure at least initially is very capital intensive. According to analysis from the Energy Bill's website, The contribution of energy network costs in household energy bills has increased from XN2 2015 to why in 2025, making it one of the biggest drivers in energy bill increases

### Gas Boiler versus Heatpump
The gas boiler is cheap to manufacture and easy to install, Particularly for replacement jobs. For a typical Home or a replacement gas boiler might cost 2 1/2 thousand pounds add in a typical year might Result in a gas bill of £1250. Retrofitting a heat pump might cost upwards of £12,000 Without government grants and might result in annual electricity costs of £750, Or potentially lower if the house all has a battery and or solar PV installed.

### ICE versus EVs
Least expensive component in an EV is the battery, Costing upwards of X thousand pounds toward the typical cost of a family size TV. In a traditional petrol car the equivalent is a simple fuel tank which costs around X pounds and holds 10 times as much energy. The cost of Driving a mile in a typical petrol car let's say a one and a half litre VW golf is expense per mile. For an identical size TV, the cost of driving that mile at least on cheap overnight electricity taken from the grid would be more like two pence. 


## Compounding - the effect on gearing
The effect of higher interest rates has another knock on effect through the impact it has on the balance sheet of utilities and other investments in the Energy sector. Debt is cheaper than equity, Or shareholder money, And borrowing money from a bank in Naples investments and energy to be done at a lower cost. However the banks or other lenders that provide such finance have limits in terms of how much they think it is safe and reasonable to lend. And when interest rates are higher, the cost of servicing debts is also higher, Meaning that a project cannot sensibly borrow as much without running the risk of running out of money and not being able to reliably Services debts. This creates a knock on effect with projects have to stamp up more shareholder or equity money, Which being more expensive further drives up the cost of capital on investments in the energy sector and results in higher costs to consumers or less investment taking place. You can see this dynamic playing out very clearly in the annual CFD auctions for offshore wind which have increased from £6 per hour in 2022 to unexpected level of Y pounds in 2025.

## Compounding - when the cause is supply side inflation
Inflation can have different causes. In 2022, the shock was largely one that started in Energy and commodities. At the same time, To hangover effects of Covid furlough schemes meant a simultaneous shock took place in labour markets. For renewable projects that are capital intensive and require large amounts of both specialist labour and materials that require lots of energy such as steel and concrete, There was a perfect storm for cost inflation.

 this meant that renewable projects have had to deal with cost increases from two simultaneous drivers, the cost of engineering and the cost of financing that engineering over the lifetime of the project

## Collapse of offshore wind

The current ways that the offshore wind industry town a helpful metaphor for the effects of the last few years. The prolonged period of ultra low interest rates and interesting climate change lead to unparalleled investment in offshore wind between 2010 and 2020. They were massive improvements in the supply chain and efficiency of building offshore turbines. The size of turbines increased from x MW to x MW, which increased yields and reduced the number of foundations required.

Even going into the initial energy crisis of 2022, offshore wind maintained momentum. The spike in fossil fuel prices left offshore wind looking incredibly attractive, and some of the cost rises had not fully worked their way through the system yet. Interest rates had either not peaked, nor had the market realised for quite how long they would need to stay at elevated levels in a bid to control the persistent inflation that had crept into the system.
