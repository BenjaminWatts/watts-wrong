# Chapter 18: 9-5 & School Holidays - Why Timing Matters for Energy

If you ask a typical well-informed Brit when then electricity grid feels the most strain, chances are they'll respond with the old story about balancing the spike in kettle use that happens during must watch TV events and especially knock-out Euros and World Cup England football matches. While it's a memorable story that explains the need for hydro pumped storage (and these days, batteries) on the grid quite poignantly, it's never really been true.

The reality is rather less charming. Much of the electricity spike comes from fridge compressors in pubs and homes as spectators grab cold drinks during the match. And yes, there's also a surge from water companies as everyone rushes to the toilet during half-time, forcing pumping stations to work overtime to refill cisterns. Neither of these explanations has quite the same romantic appeal as the tea-making story, so it's no wonder the kettle myth persists - it's much more British.

The bigger explanation as to why this isn't true however is that major England football matches, which in the age of Netflix are about the last remaining collective live TV event, are at the wrong time of year and day. The grid is never under much strain at 8-9pm on a summer evening, when the World Cup or Euros matches are typically held. Instead, the reality of when the grid is under most strain is far more mundane, but predictable, and it is between 4pm and 7pm on winter weekday evenings and during school term times. There are a number of complementary reasons for high demand:

1. It gets dark from 3pm onwards, especially in mid winter, further north and on overcast days. This drives a need for lighting both in buildings and on streets that doesn't exist to the same degree in the rest of the year. And while the development of LED lighting has dramatically cut the use of electricity in this space, lighting remains a significant contributor to UK electricity demand during winter months.

2. It's colder in winter, which created greater demands for heating. 

4. Families begin the preparation of evening meals, especially those with younger children. Cooking appliances use lots of electricity, especially ovens!

5. The end of the school working day at 3-4pm and office working day at 5pm creates a particular spike in home heating demand as thermostats warm-up homes in preparation for people arriving home.

6. The mismatch of the end of the school working day (3-4pm) and office working day (5pm) creates an overlap period from 4 to 5:30pm when most offices are still open and using electriciy for computers, lighting or machinery, but many households and especially those with children are at home and using appliances there e.g. for cooking. This coincidence, the use of electricity in boths sets of locations at once, albeit only for a relatively short period of time, is what drives the need to a lot of the investment in our energy system and the costs we see on our bills.

There are laudable attempts by suppliers to discourage use of electricity in peak periods. Smart tariffs reward customers for this and this is possible because the suppliers can avoid more expensive wholesale energy prices in the peak hours, when the least efficient power stations and batteries are needed to meet demand, as well as punative charges from the electricity networks. Over time, automation and remote control of home batteries, heatpumps and EVs is likely to extend this short of demand response much further and without any conscious behevaiour from end users. Indeed, given the spike in electricity demand over the 4-7pm period is often only 5-8 GW, it would only take around 2-3 million homes installing a standard 3kW battery to completely eliminate this peak. That said, as we use more power and especially power from renewables, the goal posts may shift higher further into the future.

It begs the question of whether a more root-and-branch review of how we structure our working day might be called for. The norms we have - such as the 9-5 working day for adults and 13 weeks of school holidays per year - are a legacy of Victorian industrial practices, for example when children were needed to gather summer harvest crops. Recent evidence has called into question the productivity of knowledge-focused work in particular, with research suggesting that an 8-hour working day may not be optimal for cognitive tasks. Closing offices earlier would significantly reduce electricity demand during peak periods, allow working parents to more easily collect children from school, and bring substantive improvements to mental health and road safety (fewer journeys completed in the dark).

Another aspect of why our current working day adds so much to energy bills is that we only really put significant pressure on the energy system for a relatively short period of time. So the fixed cost of maintaining an energy system capable of meeting these peak demands is spread over a relatively limited number of hours and days. The main winter season lasts from early November (just after the clocks go back) to late February. During this period, there is much less pressure on the grid on weekend evenings (which account for 2 out of 7 days). There is also significantly less pressure on Friday evenings, as people are more likely to head out straight from the office, eat later, or dine out. This pattern is further interrupted by the Christmas fortnight and, to some extent, the February half-term week, which also sometimes falls in a different week around the country. And from the start of March, even if the weather isn't much warmer, the lighter evenings are enough to cut the use of much lighting. Putting all this together, there are only really around 70 potential evenings - Monday to Thursdays between November and February. And if the weather is particulrly mild and windy, which with climate change it often is, this can further reduce the strain on the grid as heating demand is lower and there is abundant wind generation on the grid. In many winters, we might realistically only face 20 evenings when we put much strain on the grid. 

However, adopting a model where we require dynamic behaviour change in response to strains on the grid has risks. It is likely to be inherently disruptive, like the overnight routine changes faced by many families during COVID. The alternative - blackouts - are vastly more disruptive, so it would always be worth even very drastic action to avoid this eventuality. But even with automated solutions like smart batteries and EVs, there's still a strong case for a more joined-up approach that considers broader social, education, and health policy. The 9-5 working day and school hours that create our peak energy demand aren't just energy policy issues - they affect family life, mental health, road safety, and educational outcomes. A coordinated approach that addresses these multiple benefits could be more effective than relying solely on technological fixes. Moreover, making an overall and permanent change - such as shifting typical working hours earlier - would be more predictable for both the energy system and for families, rather than requiring constant adaptation to grid conditions.
