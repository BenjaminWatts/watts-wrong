# Analysis: Battery Storage as Distribution Network Buffer

## Summary
**Source**: LinkedIn discussion between Jordan Taylor (National Grid) and Ben Watts  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Research & Analysis  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

## Problem
Ben Watts suggested that "batteries should act as a buffer to distribution networks" in response to Jordan Taylor's concern about mandatory solar requiring massive distribution network investment. This represents an important technical solution that needs detailed analysis.

## Current Status
- Battery storage covered in flexibility and balancing content
- Distribution network buffering role not fully explored
- Technical and economic feasibility needs assessment
- Policy and regulatory framework requires analysis

## Tasks

### Research Tasks
