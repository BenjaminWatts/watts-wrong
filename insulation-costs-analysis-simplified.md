# Research: Insulation Costs and Scale Analysis

## Summary
**Source**: LinkedIn comment from Lewis Bowick (Energy Systems Consultant at Energy Systems Catapult)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Research & Analysis  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

## Problem
Lewis Bowick raised concerns about insulation costs appearing low in the current content and suggested that the potential scale looks high. This requires verification and analysis to ensure accurate cost data and scale projections.

## Current Status
- Insulation costs mentioned in current chapters may be outdated or inaccurate
- Scale projections may not reflect realistic deployment scenarios
- Need to compare multiple sources for cost verification

## Tasks

### Research Tasks
1. **Cost Analysis**
   - [ ] Review current insulation cost data in relevant chapters
   - [ ] Compare with recent industry reports (DECC, BEIS, Energy Saving Trust)
   - [ ] Analyze regional cost variations across UK
   - [ ] Include installation, materials, and labor costs

2. **Scale Assessment**
   - [ ] Review current scale projections for insulation deployment
   - [ ] Compare with government targets and industry capacity
   - [ ] Analyze supply chain constraints and bottlenecks
   - [ ] Assess realistic deployment timelines

3. **Source Verification**
   - [ ] Identify 3-5 authoritative sources for cost data
   - [ ] Cross-reference scale projections with multiple studies
   - [ ] Include both government and industry perspectives
   - [ ] Document methodology and assumptions

### Content Updates
- [ ] Update relevant chapters with verified cost data
- [ ] Revise scale projections based on realistic scenarios
- [ ] Add footnotes with source citations
- [ ] Include discussion of cost variations and uncertainties

## Deliverables
- Updated cost analysis with multiple source verification
- Revised scale projections with realistic constraints
- Source comparison table
- Updated chapter content with proper citations
