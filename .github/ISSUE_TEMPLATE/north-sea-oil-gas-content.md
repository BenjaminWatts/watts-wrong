**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Content Addition  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Seb Kennedy asked "Anything in there about North Sea oil and gas?" indicating a gap in coverage of this critical energy sector. Ben Watts acknowledged that many points from the shale gas section are relevant to the North Sea, particularly regarding tax take on domestic production.
