# Content Addition: Tidal Energy Analysis

## 📋 Issue Summary
**Source**: LinkedIn comment from Nick J D (Marine Energy Systems Expert)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Content Addition  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Nick J D asked "Anything on Tidal?" and Ben Watts responded that it's "definitely an interesting/expensive missed opportunity depending on one's perspective." This suggests tidal energy deserves dedicated coverage as a significant renewable energy option for the UK.

## 📝 Current Status
- Tidal energy not explicitly covered in current chapters
- Ben acknowledged it as an "interesting/expensive missed opportunity"
- UK has significant tidal resources but limited deployment
- Technology is proven but costs remain high

## 🔍 What Needs to Be Done

### Content Development
1. **New Section on Tidal Energy**
   - [ ] Cover UK tidal energy potential and resources
   - [ ] Analyze current and planned projects
   - [ ] Discuss technology options (tidal stream, tidal range)
   - [ ] Compare with international developments

2. **Key Topics to Address**
   - [ ] **Resource Assessment**: UK tidal energy potential
   - [ ] **Technology Options**: Tidal stream vs. tidal range
   - [ ] **Current Projects**: Swansea Bay, MeyGen, etc.
   - [ ] **Cost Analysis**: LCOE compared to other renewables
   - [ ] **Grid Integration**: Predictability and grid benefits
   - [ ] **Environmental Impact**: Marine ecosystem considerations
   - [ ] **Policy Support**: Current and needed policy frameworks
   - [ ] **International Comparison**: France, South Korea, Canada

3. **Expert Input**
   - [ ] Include perspectives from Nick J D (marine energy systems)
   - [ ] Reference industry reports and studies
   - [ ] Include cost-benefit analysis
   - [ ] Discuss "missed opportunity" angle

### Integration
- [ ] Link to renewable energy policy discussions
- [ ] Connect to grid balancing and flexibility themes
- [ ] Reference in energy mix optimization
- [ ] Update renewable energy overview sections

## 📊 Expected Deliverables
- New section on tidal energy (1,500-2,000 words)
- Cost analysis and comparison with other renewables
- Expert insights and industry perspectives
- Updated renewable energy coverage

2 weeks from issue creation

## 🔗 Related Issues
- Links to renewable energy policy content
- May relate to grid balancing discussions

## 💬 Discussion
Tidal energy represents a significant opportunity for the UK given our tidal resources, but high costs and limited policy support have constrained development. This content will explore why it's both an opportunity and a "missed opportunity."
