            <h1>Chapter 21: Shale Gas - A Missed Opportunity</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Shale gas is one of those energy topics that gets people really worked up. As someone who cares deeply about climate change, I understand why - the idea of more fossil fuels makes environmentalists nervous. But when shale gas was being debated in Britain, I heard a lot of misleading arguments on both sides. Some claimed it would solve all our energy problems and make gas dirt cheap. Others insisted it would poison our water and cause earthquakes. The reality, as so often happens with energy policy, was somewhere in between.</p>
<p>What&#39;s particularly frustrating about Britain&#39;s shale gas story is that it never really got a fair hearing. The debate was so polarised that reasonable discussion became impossible. And in the end, we threw away a potential source of domestic energy that could have made us more secure and wealthier, without really understanding what we were giving up.</p>
<h2>Why shale gas mattered</h2>
<p>Britain has been importing more and more gas over the years. We used to produce most of what we needed from the North Sea, but that&#39;s been declining since around 2000. These days, about half our gas comes from abroad - mostly from Norway via pipeline, but also from the US and Qatar as liquefied natural gas (LNG).</p>
<p>When you buy energy from abroad, you&#39;re not just spending money - you&#39;re also missing out on all the economic benefits that would come from producing it at home. Every pound spent on imported gas is a pound that doesn&#39;t create British jobs, doesn&#39;t generate British tax revenue, and doesn&#39;t build British infrastructure.</p>
<p>Had we developed our shale gas resources, we would have created jobs in the regions where the gas was found. These aren&#39;t just drilling jobs either - there&#39;s a whole supply chain of engineers, truck drivers, equipment manufacturers, and service companies that would have benefited. The salaries in oil and gas are typically £65,000-75,000 a year, roughly double the national average. That means each worker pays significantly more in taxes than the average British worker.</p>
<p>The tax benefits are even more dramatic. Oil and gas companies pay some of the highest taxes in the economy - around 65-75% of their profits go to the Treasury, compared to 25% for most businesses. For every pound spent on gas produced in Britain, about 21-27p goes back to the government in taxes. For imported LNG, it&#39;s more like 5p (just the VAT). With our energy imports running at £25-35 billion a year, that&#39;s a lot of potential tax revenue we&#39;re missing out on.</p>
<h2>The great price myth</h2>
<p>One of the most common arguments for shale gas was that it would make gas much cheaper. &quot;Look at America!&quot; people would say. &quot;Gas is dirt cheap there now!&quot; But this argument missed some crucial differences between Britain and the US.</p>
<p>The US shale boom happened because America had massive reserves of shale gas that were globally significant. When the US started producing shale gas in huge quantities, it changed the global gas market. Britain, by contrast, has much smaller shale gas reserves. Even if we&#39;d produced every drop of our technically recoverable shale gas, it wouldn&#39;t have moved global gas prices one bit.</p>
<p>More importantly, Britain is part of a global gas market. If we&#39;d produced shale gas here, it would have been sold at the same price as gas from Norway, Qatar, or anywhere else. The companies producing it would have wanted to maximise their profits, not give us a discount. The only way to force them to sell it cheaper would have been to create some kind of special British gas market, which would have been incompatible with our trading arrangements and probably illegal under various international agreements.</p>
<p>So shale gas wouldn&#39;t have made gas cheaper in Britain. But it would have meant that more of the money we spend on gas stayed in Britain rather than going abroad.</p>
<h2>The environmental case</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s where things get interesting. Despite what many environmentalists assumed, shale gas might actually have been better for the environment than the alternatives we&#39;re using today.</p>
<p>Most of our imported gas comes as LNG from the US and Qatar. Getting gas from the ground in the US, turning it into a liquid, shipping it across the ocean, and turning it back into gas creates a lot of emissions. The total lifecycle emissions for US shale LNG are around 295-310 grams of CO2 per kWh. Even Qatari LNG, which is slightly cleaner, comes in at 285-302 grams.</p>
<p>British shale gas, by contrast, would have eliminated all those transport emissions. The total lifecycle emissions would likely have been around 251-268 grams of CO2 per kWh - a 15-20% reduction compared to imported LNG.</p>
<p>This is the kind of environmental analysis that rarely gets discussed in the heat of the shale gas debate. But it&#39;s crucial: if your goal is to reduce emissions, then replacing high-carbon imports with lower-carbon domestic production makes sense.</p>
<p>The environmental benefits of gas go beyond just direct emissions comparisons. Natural gas is fundamentally a transition fuel - much cleaner than oil or coal, but still a fossil fuel that we&#39;ll eventually need to phase out. However, this transition role is crucial for enabling the clean energy technologies that will replace it. With gas fired power providing about one-third of the current total on the grid, heat pumps (at 350% efficiency) reduce the use of emissions and gas by about 90% compared to a condensing gas boiler that&#39;s 90% efficient. An EV that travels 5km per kWh reduces total emissions by about 90% compared to a petrol car achieving 40mpg. In both cases, electrification also shifts emissions away from homes and people to power stations, where we might one day be able to capture and store them.</p>
<p>This is why my support for shale gas is quite different from support for shale oil. While gas and oil deposits often occur together, finds that are skewed towards gas rather than oil are potentially much more interesting from an environmental and economic perspective. Gas can play this crucial transition role in enabling cleaner electricity and heating. </p>
<p>Britain&#39;s shale gas potential was particularly interesting because the geological formations suggested gas-rich rather than oil-rich deposits. This meant we could have developed a domestic energy source that would have supported the transition to cleaner technologies, rather than simply extending our dependence on high-carbon transport fuels.</p>
<h2>Why Britain said no</h2>
<p>So if shale gas wouldn&#39;t have made gas cheaper but would have created jobs, generated tax revenue, and actually reduced emissions, why did Britain reject it?</p>
<p>The answer is politics, pure and simple. The largest shale gas reserves in Britain were found in politically inconvenient places. The Bowland-Hodder formation stretches from Lancashire through Yorkshire to Staffordshire. The Weald Basin covers parts of Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, and Kent.</p>
<p>Lancashire alone contained four marginal constituencies where the Conservative majority was less than 1.5% in the 2019 election. These weren&#39;t constituencies where the government could afford to lose votes. Meanwhile, the Weald Basin covers affluent Surrey constituencies like Surrey Heath and Woking, which are home to wealthy donors and politically connected individuals who can make their feelings known in ways that matter to politicians.</p>
<p>The opposition took different forms in different places. In Lancashire, there was genuine grassroots concern about the environmental impact. In Surrey, there was more organised, well-funded opposition from affluent residents who didn&#39;t want drilling anywhere near their expensive homes.</p>
<p>Had the shale reserves been located in different parts of the country - perhaps in rural areas with fewer marginal seats - the politics might have been very different. But they weren&#39;t, and so the government chose to protect the electoral interests of a few key constituencies over the economic interests of the country as a whole.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of how energy policy gets made in Britain. What should be a decision based on energy security, economics, and environmental impact becomes a calculation about electoral maths and political pressure.</p>
<h2>What we lost</h2>
<p>The economic impact of Britain&#39;s shale gas ban is hard to quantify precisely, but it&#39;s substantial. We lost the chance to create thousands of jobs in regions that could really use them. We lost billions in potential tax revenue. We became more dependent on foreign gas suppliers, which means we&#39;re more vulnerable to global energy price shocks.</p>
<p>More importantly, we lost the chance to build up domestic energy expertise and infrastructure. The skills and equipment needed for shale gas development could have formed the foundation for other energy industries. The gas processing and distribution networks could have supported other energy technologies.</p>
<p>We also lost credibility as a place to invest in energy projects. If Britain can&#39;t develop its own energy resources because of political opposition, why should companies invest in other energy projects here? This kind of policy uncertainty makes it harder to attract the investment we need for wind, solar, and other energy technologies.</p>
<h2>The bigger lesson</h2>
<p>Britain&#39;s shale gas experience reveals something important about how we make energy policy decisions. Too often, we let short-term political considerations override long-term national interests. We let local opposition from vocal minorities prevent developments that would benefit the country as a whole.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t to say that local concerns don&#39;t matter. They do. But there needs to be a better way to balance local interests with national needs. Perhaps we need better ways to compensate communities that host energy infrastructure. Perhaps we need better processes for weighing environmental risks against economic benefits.</p>
<p>As Britain faces similar challenges with nuclear power, offshore wind, transmission lines, and other energy infrastructure, the lessons from shale gas become even more relevant. We can&#39;t afford to let every energy project get bogged down in local politics. We need to find ways to make energy policy decisions that serve the national interest while respecting local concerns.</p>
<p>The shale gas story also shows how important it is to base energy policy on evidence rather than emotion. The environmental case against shale gas was often based on fears rather than facts. The economic case was often oversold by its supporters. We need better, more honest discussions about the real costs and benefits of different energy options.</p>
<p>Britain&#39;s energy future depends on making better decisions about how to balance environmental protection, economic development, and energy security. If we can&#39;t get this basic calculation right for shale gas, how are we going to make the much more complex decisions about nuclear power, renewable energy, and carbon capture that lie ahead?</p>
<p>The shale gas opportunity is gone. But the need for better energy policy decision-making remains. Let&#39;s hope we learn the right lessons from this missed opportunity.</p>
