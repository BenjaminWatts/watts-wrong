<h1 id="chapter-2-biomass">Chapter 2: Biomass</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Biomass is the burning of wood or crops for energy. Mankind has
relied on it since first burning firewood. With industrialisation in the
19th and 20th centuries, it got displaced by more abundant and energy
dense fossil fuels like coal (and later oil and gas). In Britain today,
the mostly use biomass in wood fires stoves heating homes and at the
massive Drax power station.</p>
<h2 id="whats-good-about-biomass">What‚Äôs good about biomass?</h2>
<p>Before slating it, it‚Äôs worth noting biomass technologies have a
number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexible storage</strong>: biomass fuels such as wood
pellets, biodiesel/ethanol can be stored in silos or big tanks just like
fossil fuels, ready to be burnt when they‚Äôre needed. Compared to
electrified renewable technologies like wind and solar, they don‚Äôt
necessitate storing energy in batteries that use rare earth materials,
and they‚Äôre often not too much of a risk to the environment when they‚Äôre
stored. They can also be used for heat (e.g.¬†a stove), transport (e.g.¬†a
biodiesel car/truck) or power generation (e.g.¬†Drax).</li>
<li><strong>Conversion</strong>: you can often repurpose or convert
existing fossil fuel appliances to run on biomass fuels. Drax power
station previously burnt coal, diesel cars and trucks can be converted
to run on vegetable oil derived biodiesel, coal fireplaces can be
retrofitted with a wooden stove.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Adoption</strong>: because they‚Äôre tangible and
similar to fossil fuels, they‚Äôre often easier to persuade consumers to
switch to. Biodiesel and bioethanol fuelled cars engender less range
anxiety than EVs. Biomass boilers require less modification to home
radiators than heatpumps.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-problem-with-biomass">So what‚Äôs the problem with
Biomass?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, biomass isn‚Äôt efficient. It‚Äôs a very old technology,
dating to cavepeople‚Äôs first use of firewood, and we have to rely on
some plant‚Äôs growth cycle to capture stored energy. Plants aren‚Äôt that
efficient at storing the energy they photosynthesize from sunlight. To
get any meaningful contribution to our energy needs from biomass
requires large scale cultivation of crops and plants. And when we burn
biomass fuels in power stations or stoves, we are lucky to usefully
extract 30 or 40% of the energy the plants have captured. All together,
this means to get any siginificant proportion of our energy from biomass
requires converting massive tracts of land to growing large numbers of
similar plants or crops. Such monocultures can‚Äôt fail to have profound
impacts on ecosystems affecting other wildlife, and competing with use
of land for food production.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-drax">How do you solve a problem
like Drax?</h2>
<p>Drax is massive. It is the largest power station the UK has ever had,
with a capacity of 3,960 megawatts - enough to power over 6 million
homes. It was built in 1974 in Yorkshire on the banks of the River Ouse,
to burn coal sourced from the nearby Yorkshire coal fields. At the time,
almost all Britain‚Äôs power came from coal, and there were many other
power stations like Drax. In the rivers like the Ouse, Trent, and Aire
that empty into the River Humber, the area was nicknamed ‚Äúmegawatt
valley‚Äù and accounted for over 40% of Britain‚Äôs power generation at its
peak. When Drax opened in 1974, it was the largest coal-fired power
station in Europe and one of the biggest in the world - a symbol of
Britain‚Äôs industrial might and energy ambitions. At its peak, Drax was
one of the largest carbon emitters in Europe, releasing over 20 million
tonnes of CO2 annually - more than many entire countries. While there
are larger coal plants in Germany and Eastern Europe, Drax was certainly
among the biggest emitters in Western Europe.</p>
<p>When the UK signed up to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2009,
it committed to generate 15% of its energy from renewable sources by
2020. At the time, only around 3% of Britain‚Äôs power was from
renewables, and the challenge seemed daunting, especially as Britain‚Äôs
most established low carbon generation technology, nuclear power,
couldn‚Äôt be used toward the target. Now as it turned out, in 2020
Britain generated 24% of its power from wind and a further 4% from
solar, because these technologies fell drastically in price and were
deployed at scale around the country in a way that exceeded earlier
expectations. So Britain never needed Drax to meet this target. Britain
also left the EU in 2020-1, which certainly wasn‚Äôt expected in 2009!</p>
<p>Successive governments and energy ministers have been terrified of
losing Drax‚Äôs generation capacity. In particular, the spectre of 1970s
blackouts haunted Conservative administrations from 2010-2024, creating
a political climate where keeping the lights on trumped all else. So
when Drax‚Äôs owners proposed converting initially two generating units in
2012, and then two more in 2016 and 2018, ministers decided to bend the
rules for subsidising renewable technologies to include biomass. This
wasn‚Äôt entirely unprecedented‚Äîdedicated biomass power plants had been
receiving Renewables Obligation Certificates since 2002, typically
earning 1.5 ROCs per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. Examples
included Steven‚Äôs Croft Power Station in Scotland (44 MW, operational
from 2008), which burns a mix of 60% waste from timber production, 20%
coppiced wood, and 20% recycled fibre, and the Elean Power Station in
Cambridgeshire (38 MW, operational from 2000), which burns straw,
oilseed rape, and miscanthus. At current ROC values of ¬£64.73 per
certificate, 1.5 ROCs provide an additional ¬£97 per MWh on top of the
wholesale electricity price.</p>
<p>The first two Drax units (2012) received Renewables Obligation
Certificates (ROCs), while the later units (2016-2018) received
Contracts for Difference (CfDs) through a separate non-competitive
arrangement called a ‚ÄúFinal Investment Decision‚Äù (FiD) enabling
contract, which unlike the transparent auctions for wind and solar
wasn‚Äôt a very open or competitive process. Instead, it was more of a
direct negotiation between Drax‚Äôs private owners and government
ministers and civil servants. The guaranteed prices Drax gets for its
power are around ¬£150-170/MWh today, and are guaranteed to increase each
year in-line with inflation for 15 years after the conversion process,
meaning between 2027 and 2033.</p>
<p>Given the quantity of wood pellets Drax needs to meet its annual
energy requirement of around 20,000 GWh, it couldn‚Äôt rely on British (or
even European) sourced wood. So it turned to North America. The
environmental and social impacts of this large-scale wood pellet
industry have been extensively documented, including in a <a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0018q8k">BBC
documentary</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the concerns with Biomass, the price paid for Drax‚Äôs power is
significantly more than other power generators:</p>
<p><strong>Conventional power plants</strong> receive only the wholesale
electricity price, currently around ¬£50-80 per MWh depending on market
conditions. <strong>New wind projects</strong> those under consideration
today (for the upcoming AR6 subsidy round) are expected to get
¬£110-150/MWh in today‚Äôs prices.</p>
<h2 id="wood-stoves-and-pellet-boilers---smoke-and-subsidies">Wood
stoves and pellet boilers - smoke and subsidies</h2>
<p>As well as being used in the largest power station in the country,
biomass is well established for heating homes and buildings. Wood fires
are aesthetically pleasing, and stoves and biomass boilers can achieve
70-85% efficiency, comparing favourably with gas and oil boilers which
typically achieve 85-95% efficiency. In many rural areas, routine tree
surgery creates a ready supply of timber, making biomass an attractive
local energy source. Wood stoves are resilient to blackouts too.</p>
<p>However, the growth of wood burning in urban areas, particularly
during the 2022 energy crisis, has created significant air pollution
problems. Wood stoves and open fires emit high levels of particulate
matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, and other harmful pollutants
that contribute to poor air quality and respiratory health issues. These
are localised pollution problems, in contrast to the global nature of
climate change. In response, the government has introduced regulations
to phase out the sale of the most polluting fuels and stoves, with new
restrictions on wet wood and coal sales coming into effect in recent
years.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, subsidies for Biomass became particularly
controversial when the Northern Ireland Audit Office revealed in 2016
that a subsidy to promote biomass use in smaller businesses (like farms)
had been overly generous. Because the subsidy offered exceeded the cost
of wood pellets, businesses had an incentive to burn as much biomass as
possible. This experience has rightly made subsequent governments around
the UK more critical</p>
<h2 id="biofuels">Biofuels</h2>
<p>Less topical of late, petrol and diesel are required to contain 5-10%
of biofuel, typically derived from crops like corn, sugarcane, and palm
oil. This creates a direct competition between fuel and food production,
as agricultural land is converted from growing food to growing energy
crops. The result is often large-scale monoculture plantations that
replace diverse ecosystems, reduce biodiversity, and can drive up food
prices in regions where these crops are grown. In some cases, the
environmental impact of clearing forests for biofuel plantations has
been so severe that the carbon emissions from land-use change exceed the
carbon savings from using biofuels instead of fossil fuels. The cost of
manufacturing biofuels significantly higher than fossil fuel derived
petrol and diesel too, at least before taxes are added.</p>
<hr />
<h1
id="chapter-3-feed-in-tariffs-and-rocs---how-subsidies-went-wrong">Chapter
3: Feed-in Tariffs and ROCs - How Subsidies Went Wrong</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs often difficult for new technologies to get off the ground. Not
only do you have to get the cost of manufacturing kit down, and the kit
more reliable, but you also need a supply chain to distribute and an
qualified workforce to install and maintain the equipment. This is
particularly true if you want something installed en masse to millions
of homnes and businesses, but also a handful of larger sites like power
stations.</p>
<h2 id="pv">PV</h2>
<p>Solar photovoltaic (or PV) technology is a watershed moment for
making electricity. Unlike every other way of making electricity, it
doesn‚Äôt rely on moving parts like spinning a generator. It therefore
requires much less maintenance or frequent access. Given it‚Äôs relatively
light, thin and flat, it can also be readily installed on existing
building surfaces like roofs, and also be ground mounted. It also
generates most electricity in the day time, when people are more likely
to be awake, working and using electricity. Also, because it can be
installed ‚Äúbehind the meter‚Äù of buildings, it offers the chance to
bypass the charges of local energy grids, taxes and allow end users to
generate some of their own power.</p>
<h3 id="feed-in-tariff">Feed in tariff</h3>
<p>The UK isn‚Äôt blessed with the world‚Äôs sunniest climate, but despite
this a well positioned kilowatt of PV panels will generate an average of
about 1kwh/day of power in winter and 4kwh/day in summer. A typical
house without electric heating, a heatpump or an EV might use 3,000kwh
of electricity in a year, and a typical roof can accommodate 3-5kw of PV
panels. So on a net, year round basis, PV can make a typical UK house
self-sufficient for electricity, although in reality they will have a
daytime surplus in summer and maintain a heavy grid reliance in
winter.</p>
<p>Seeing this potential, the (outgoing) Labour government in 2010
decided to launch a Feed-in Tariff, initially with a payment of 43.3p
per kWh for every unit of solar electricity generated. Crucially, this
payment is made even if the electricity is used onsite and never reaches
the public grid. This was incredibly generous, at the time electricity
from the grid typically cost just 8-12p per kWh. At the time, there were
very few contractors able to install the equipment, and homeowners
needed a strong incentive to consider the substantial financial
investment. At the time in 2010, a typical installation could cost
¬£12,000-15,000, so with the feed-in tariff offered the expected payback
was around 8-10 years.</p>
<p>Given the Feed-in Tariff was guaranteed for 25 years in line with
inflation, some of the oldest PV installations in the country are still
turning their owners a tidy profit, indeed when uprated with inflation
they are now earning around 71p per kWh, which for a typical 3kW
installation represents an annual revenue of over ¬£2,000, though
degradation can eat into this significantly.</p>
<h4 id="boom-bust">Boom bust</h4>
<p>In the years following the adoption of the Feed-in Tariff in 2010,
the number of installations started to grow, little at first but
gradually more and more as the cost of installations fell and homeowner
confidence grew behind the earliest adopters. However, as the price of
the installations fell, installation interest only went up more as the
payback period fell. This left the government playing cat and mouse with
the industry, as it started creating frequent deadlines when it would
review and revise downward, as deemed appropriate, the level of
feed-in-tariff subsidy. More and more installers entered the industry as
well, operating at larger scale and at times with some sacrifice to the
quality of workmanship. The pace of cuts to the feed-in tariff
accelerated until March 2019, when the government announced an end to
new entrants to the scheme, with the final closure taking effect in
April 2019.</p>
<p>The boom peaked in 2011-2012 when over 200,000 solar PV systems were
installed annually, with the industry employing around 25,000 people. By
2019, when the scheme closed, annual installations had fallen to fewer
than 30,000, and the workforce had shrunk to approximately 5,000 - an
80% reduction in both installations and employment.</p>
<p>The closure of the Feed-in Tariff scheme created a massive bust in
the industry, as the replacement support vehicle, called the Smart
Export Guarantee, provides no support for generation unless it is
exported to the grid. Consequently, a large number of installers went
out of business. This was undesirable because:</p>
<p><strong>Aftercare</strong>: Customers were unable to get aftercare
for faults with installations. In particular, the Microgeneration
Certification Scheme (MCS) - the industry body responsible for
maintaining standards and providing consumer protection - failed to step
in as many would have expected, leaving homeowners with faulty systems
and no recourse. This reinforced scepticism among some consumers about
the technology.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Premium</strong>: Attracting more workers and investment
into the PV sector in the future became harder because many were
sceptical that government might again engineer boom-bust cycles,
creating uncertainty about the long-term viability of renewable energy
investments.</p>
<p><strong>Ripple Effects</strong>: After installers went bust,
homeowners with defective installations pursued the MCS Certification
Body and in some cases bank/finance lenders. The outdated Section 75
consumer credit legislation, where lenders can be held responsible for
the quality of home improvements they lend toward still makes financial
institutions hesitant to lend for home retrofit.</p>
<h4 id="inequality-and-legacy">Inequality and Legacy</h4>
<p>While the Feed-in Tariff scheme has now closed to new entrants,
payments will continue until 2044 and its legacy lives on in several
problematic ways:</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Inequality</strong>: The scheme disproportionately
benefitted wealthier households who could afford the ¬£12,000-15,000
upfront investment in the 2010s. This created a form of ‚Äúsolar
aristocracy‚Äù where affluent homeowners received decades of premium
payments while others missed out.</p>
<p><strong>Access Barriers</strong>: The scheme was fundamentally
unavailable to renters, flat-dwellers, and those without suitable roof
space, creating a divide between property owners and those without
access to suitable installation sites.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Disparity</strong>: Solar yields in Scotland are
20-30% lower than in southern England, meaning the scheme‚Äôs benefits
were geographically skewed toward wealthier, sunnier regions.</p>
<p><strong>Market Distortion</strong>: The Feed-in Tariff was simple to
understand and calculate paybacks, but its 25-year fixed duration takes
no account of the declining value of solar generation during
increasingly frequent periods of renewable energy abundance. This means
early adopters continue receiving premium rates even when their
electricity has minimal value to the grid.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Burden</strong>: In common with other electricity
levies (see <a href="chapters/10-electricity-levies.md">Chapter 10:
Electricity Levies - Hidden Costs Everywhere</a>), the cost of Feed-in
Tariffs was added to the electricity bills of all consumers. Those who
consume more units of electricity contribute more, while users that buy
less electricity from the grid (e.g.¬†those with solar PV) pay less.</p>
<p>The FIT scheme closed to new applications in 2019, but payments to
existing installations will continue until 2044, creating a long-term
cost legacy that all electricity consumers must bear.</p>
<h3 id="renewable-obligation-certificates-or-rocs">Renewable Obligation
Certificates (or ROCs)</h3>
<p>Lesser known than the feed-in tariff these days, renewable obligation
certificates were introduced as a way to increase the income received by
early renewable projects plants connected to the grid. The scheme ran
from 2002 to 2017, when it closed to new projects, though payments to
existing installations continue until 2037. The main technology
supported was wind power (both onshore and offshore), followed by
biomass (including large-scale power stations like Drax) and
hydroelectric projects.</p>
<p>In common with Contracts for Difference (CfD) support schemes, ROCs
are only paid when generators are working and online, so the owner
(rather than the taxpayer) is responsible for maintaining renewable
generators in working order. This ‚Äúperformance-based‚Äù approach sounds
sensible in theory - generators only get paid when they produce
electricity.</p>
<p>The Renewables Obligation (RO) scheme supports only around 30% of
Britain‚Äôs renewable electricity generation. Despite this limited
coverage, it still contributes approximately 10% to an average
electricity bill, according to <a
href="https://climate.benjames.io/uk-electricity-bills/">recent
analysis</a>.</p>
<p>The RO scheme was particularly generous to biomass projects like Drax
and early offshore wind farms, which continue to receive premium
payments. Early offshore wind projects under ROCs received around
¬£140-150/MWh in 2012 terms. Adjusted for inflation, this translates to
roughly ¬£200-220/MWh today‚Äîsignificantly higher than current CfD prices
of around ¬£70-80/MWh for new offshore wind projects.</p>
<p>For these reasons, ROC projects still add about three times more to
electricity bills than CfD projects. However, this comparison is
somewhat misleading since many CfD projects haven‚Äôt been built yet. As
ROC projects reach the end of their support period, this imbalance will
naturally rebalance.</p>
<p>A major flaw of the ROCs scheme is the asymmetry of the support. They
prop-up, or increase the revenue of renewable generators above the
wholesale market price. However, if the wholesale market price spikes
(as it did in 2022), there is no method for clawing back or reducing the
support. Instead, the renewable generators receive bonus profits. This
was particularly evident during the 2022 energy crisis, when ROC
generators like Drax and early offshore wind farms received both their
guaranteed ROC payments AND the benefit of high wholesale prices -
effectively double-dipping at consumers‚Äô expense.</p>
<p>In truth, ROCs are actually cheaper to consumers per MWh than FITs,
but this can be misleading when looking at headline costs on electricity
bills. According to <a
href="https://climate.benjames.io/uk-electricity-bills/">recent analysis
by Ben James</a>, the Feed-in Tariff represents a smaller portion of
electricity bills - approximately 2.4% of a typical annual electricity
bill in 2025. However, ROC-subsidised renewable generators generate far
more electricity in aggregate: in 2023-24 they generated around 78 TWh,
compared to just 9 TWh from FIT generators. In terms of subsidy per MWh,
ROCs provided around ¬£50-120 per MWh (varying by technology and ROC
banding), while FITs typically provided ¬£140-190 per MWh (depending on
technology and installation size). This means ROCs were actually more
cost-effective per unit of electricity generated, but because they
supported much larger volumes of generation overall, they appear more
expensive on electricity bills.</p>
<p>These policy weaknesses contributed to the eventual replacement of
ROCs with CfDs (see <a
href="chapters/14-cfd-vs-marginal-pricing.md">Chapter 14: CfD vs
Marginal Pricing - Market Design Disasters</a>). However, no reform of
existing ROCs has been attempted, and during the 2022 energy crisis, the
government even refused to levy the windfall tax on ROC generators,
allowing them to keep their excess profits while other generators faced
additional taxation.</p>
<p>Another weakness of the ROC scheme is the perverse incentive it
creates when wholesale prices are low, which occurs during periods of
excessive renewable generation - an increasingly frequent occurrence as
Britain‚Äôs wind and solar capacity grows. When wholesale prices fall
below the level needed to cover ROC generators‚Äô costs, the grid operator
must compensate them for the shortfall, effectively paying them not to
generate electricity. This ‚Äúcurtailment compensation‚Äù means consumers
pay twice: once for the ROC subsidy and again for the generator to stay
offline.</p>
<p>ROC generators argue, with some justification, that this is a risk
they shouldn‚Äôt be liable for, as they were encouraged to build capacity
under government policy. However, the cost of wind curtailment is
growing rapidly on consumer bills, especially as the country fails to
build enough transmission cable capacity fast enough (see <a
href="chapters/06-transmission-constraints.md">Chapter 6: Transmission
Constraints - Bottlenecks and Bottlenecks</a> and <a
href="chapters/07-scotland.md">Chapter 7: Scotland - The North-South
Divide</a>). This creates a situation where the ROC scheme not only
subsidises generation when it‚Äôs needed, but also pays generators to
avoid generating when the system is oversupplied - a fundamental flaw in
the market design.</p>
<h2 id="to-renege-or-not-to-renege">To renege, or not to renege?</h2>
<p>The idea of reneging on ROC contracts has not been a mainstream
policy position under consideration by either the previous Conservative
or current Labour governments. Reneging on FIT payments hasn‚Äôt been
considered either, though given the direct impact this would have on
millions of households and smaller businesses, one assumes it would be
politically impossible.</p>
<p>However, reneging on renewable subsidies is definitely an idea
considered by the Reform party, which has argued that some schemes are
too generous and represent an unfair burden on consumers. It remains to
be seen whether Reform will win an election, or whether these radical
ideas might be adopted by other parties forming a future government.</p>
<p>For the time being, the credibility damage of reneging on subsidies,
combined with the substantial legal obstacles built into these schemes,
has prevented this from happening in the UK. Spain provides a cautionary
tale: when the government attempted to cut renewable energy subsidies by
‚Ç¨2.7 billion in 2013, it triggered over 52 international arbitration
cases with compensation payments exceeding ‚Ç¨1.6 billion, severely
damaging investor confidence in future renewable projects. Unless a
future UK government is prepared to accept similar risks, reneging on
these contracts seems unlikely, except under two specific
conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A future government abandons Net Zero targets entirely‚Äîsomething
Reform has indicated it might consider</li>
<li>The RPI inflation indexation continues to push legacy renewable
power costs significantly higher than new-build renewable or fossil fuel
projects. RPI is a widely <a
href="https://obr.uk/box/the-long-run-difference-between-rpi-and-cpi-inflation/">discredited</a>
measure of inflation that consistently overestimates inflation.</li>
</ol>
<p>As this cost gap widens and the ROC contracts become increasingly
distant from current energy policy, it‚Äôs not infeasible that a future
government may be able to renege on some of these contracts with enough
temporal and policy distance to avoid contagion risk to other energy
infrastructure projects. But this will be a balancing act, and will
result in significant legal challenge, as the system of contracts was
set up precisely to make this difficult - the government needed to
provide investors with confidence that their long-term investments in
renewable energy infrastructure would be protected from political
interference, ensuring private capital would flow into the sector. It
could also easily knock investor confidence in unrelated sectors like
water.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h2>
<p>In Britain today, the total capacity of wind farms is about 30GW. If
you look at a <a href="https://renewables-map.robinhawkes.com">map</a>
of British wind farms, it‚Äôs likely the first observations you‚Äôll have
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The North Sea is dominant</strong>: About 50% (15GW) of wind
capacity is offshore, three-quarters (12GW) of which is in the North
Sea.</li>
<li><strong>Scotland is covered with windfarms</strong>: About 30%
(10GW) of wind capacity is onshore and in Scotland.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs tempting to think this is a rational and logical distribution.
After all:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The North Sea makes sense</strong> It‚Äôs much easier to build
wind turbines offshore in the North Sea than elsewhere. It‚Äôs incredibly
shallow; it‚Äôs only 15-30 metres deep 80-125 miles from the coast at
Dogger Bank. North Sea oil and gas has been exploited for 60 years; it‚Äôs
well mapped and there are many ports on the east coast with the
infrastructure and facilities to construct and maintain the
infrastructure. It‚Äôs also adjacent to major energy trading partners and
power grids in Germany, Nordics (Denmark/Norway), the
Netherlands/Belgium; whereas the west coast only borders Ireland.</li>
<li><strong>Scotland is wild and windy</strong> Scotland has 8 times
fewer people per square mile than England (70 vs 1,100 people per square
mile). Land costs are dramatically lower too - agricultural land in
Scotland averages around ¬£4,000 per acre compared to ¬£10,000-15,000 per
acre in much of England, with prime farmland in the South East reaching
¬£20,000+ per acre.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, politics is as influential as climate and economics.
Understanding why this distribution exists requires examining both the
historical development of Britain‚Äôs energy system and the political
decisions that have shaped it.</p>
<h2 id="the-historical-context">The Historical Context</h2>
<p>If you start studying or working in the British energy market today,
there‚Äôs little to formally distinguish the energy system in Scotland
from the rest of England and Wales. It‚Äôs part of the same wholesale
market, retail consumers north and south of the border choose between
the same suppliers. Regulation on competition is identical. Taxes are
the same. And while the Scottish Government is devolved some powers in
the energy space, which it has used to permit more onshore wind
development in the planning system and offer more generous support for
heatpumps and insulation over the years compared with Westminster
administrations, this understanding misses key historical aspects.</p>
<p>History lessons can often be a bit boring, and many younger readers
may be questioning why reading about what went on in the 1980s and 1990s
might seem irrelevant. But we need to set the scene: Scotland and the
Highlands in particular are absolutely front and center of the
decarbonisation strategy that the UK is taking. The central challenge of
our electricity system over the next 10-20 years is to deliver ever
increasing, affordable and reliable supplies of wind energy, managed
intelligently and flexibly with modern technology from north to south.
Understanding why this is such a challenge requires going back to how
the system was originally designed, and what the institutional and
political frictions are as well as those of physical geography.</p>
<p>In England, the electricity grid started as private (or municipal)
undertakings in major cities in the late 19th century, with coal power
stations built to serve nearby factories and housing. The first National
Grid wasn‚Äôt built until the 1920s/30s. Even then, it didn‚Äôt extend north
of central Scotland (Glasgow and Edinburgh). Electricity in the north of
Scotland followed later, and focussed more at localised hydro schemes,
where the region‚Äôs unique geography and population density compared to
the rest of the country created a radically different grid setup.
However, after 1945 the electricity systems were largely separated and
given different structures. In England, all the power stations
(generators) were grouped together with the transmission grid, with
separate regional electricity companies doing the local distribution and
retail to end consumers. In Scotland, two vertically integrated
companies were created to cover north and south Scotland, both spanning
everything from generating power to retail. There was a small amount of
capacity between Central Scotland and Northern England to move
electricity north or south, but these links were not radically expanded
over the decades even as electricity usage grew.</p>
<p>Fast forwarding to the privatisation of the 1990s, and the model
adopted reflected the setup in England and Wales, rather than Scotland.
Whereas in England there had long been a distinction between the
transmission grid (which became National Grid) and siloed regional
distribution grids, in Scotland such barriers were less distinct. In
very rural areas, it didn‚Äôt make sense to have distinct organisations
strictly focussed at different voltage levels because the distances
between settlements were so great and the population density so low that
maintaining separate transmission and distribution networks would have
been economically inefficient. Scotland was also more self-sufficient
and contained, it wasn‚Äôt as important to the national generation
strategy. It would have been considered quite strange to try and
transmit large amounts of electricity from the Highlands all the way to
the south of England when there was so much coal generation capacity
already located in the industrial heartlands of the Midlands and
South.</p>
<h2 id="forcing-retail-competition-on-scotland">Forcing Retail
Competition on Scotland</h2>
<p>The vertically integrated Scottish electricity companies had powerful
brands. Not only did they generate and transmit/distribute electricity,
but in rural areas without gas supplies, storage heaters were supplied
and maintained by the electricity companies with special tariffs and
widespread use of remote controlled charging. The Scottish electricity
companies also had powerful retail brands, with high street shops and a
local (nationalist) identity. Even British Gas identifies itself as
Scottish Gas north of the border. Even when customers were allowed to
chose a supplier in Scotland after 1998, far fewer chose to switch than
in England. And companies with origins south of the border found it much
harder to win customers in Scotland.</p>
<h2 id="merging-wholesale-markets">Merging wholesale markets</h2>
<p>For 15 years after initial privatisations, Scotland remained outside
the wholesale market for England and Wales. It only fully joined in
2005, 15 years later than the rest of England and Wales. The Scottish
market remained dominated by the two vertically integrated electricity
companies and wholesale prices were regulated. In a market as small as
Scotland, it was deemed there simply wasn‚Äôt enough competition to rely
on a free market to set prices, and there wasn‚Äôt enough transmission
capacity with England to be part of that much larger market.</p>
<p>Prices in Scotland remained higher, despite which Scotland never saw
the same ‚Äúdash for gas‚Äù that took hold south of the border, in part
because without a liquid private market, it was more difficult for
developers to privately finance such developments. Over time, it became
clear the same impediment would limit the development of Scotland‚Äôs
increasingly abundant wind resources, which needed access to markets
south of the border.</p>
<h2 id="nimbyism-and-the-onshore-wind-ban">NIMBYism and the Onshore Wind
Ban</h2>
<p>Since the first onshore wind farm in Britain was built in Delabole,
Cornwall in 1991, some local residents have been reluctant to accept
wind farms. Interestingly, much of the opposition to the Delabole
project focused on noise abatement; today, visual disturbance tends to
be the top concern, along with construction traffic and disruption.</p>
<p>Wind farms are relatively unique in Britain for bringing into
conflict two quite different groups of stakeholders. On the one hand,
you have the developers; typically working-age urbanites who are highly
educated and strongly focused on national and international climate
challenges and supply chains. On the other hand, you have local
communities with a more diverse age range, including many retired and
non-working groups, for most of whom their home represents their largest
financial asset or pool of savings.</p>
<p>As Britain has a national grid with uniform pricing, there are no
automatic bill savings for communities located close to wind farms. With
the recent rejection of regional (and zonal) pricing; this looks set to
remain the case for the large part; however there are <a
href="https://www.elexon.co.uk/bsc/mod-proposal/p441/">ways</a> for
groups of energy users and generators the same energy supplier and
primary substation to avoid some grid levies for electricity.</p>
<p>Given how complex the planning and engineering can be, if a developer
or operator of a wind farm disturbs the day-to-day life of local
communities, getting recourse or compensation through legal means
against a large private company is likely to be too intimidating for
most local communities, even if they can organize together.</p>
<p>The center right (i.e.¬†the Conservative party) of British politics
has long harboured a scepticism for wind and solar, and despite the need
for state financial support has preferred nuclear energy. Following
their return to office in 2010 and coupled with the rapid expansion of
onshore wind farms in conservative leaning rural districts, the
Government in 2015 effectively banned any new onshore wind in England.
In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland the decision was taken by their
respective Governments to continue with onshore wind. The decision in
England was a mistake which was particularly profound because of the
lack of mitigation for the consequences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Connect and manage</strong> - Britain took the view that it
was acceptable for wind developers to build projects in areas that were
poorly served by the national and local distribution grids. This meant a
lack of coordination between projects being built and the local grid
being upgraded to accommodate them. When the two weren‚Äôt in sync, the
result was‚Äîand continues to be‚Äîthat wind farms are compensated for being
turned off (or down), which now costs ¬£3-4 billion per year.</li>
</ol>
<p>Had more wind farms been built in areas like Devon/Cornwall and the
Pennines, there would have been fewer grid problems because the biggest
constraints are north/south, especially across the Scottish border.
Additionally, because demand would be closer to generation, there would
also be smaller losses in transporting electricity long distances
through cables. The current concentration of wind farms in Scotland and
the North Sea creates a bottleneck where power has to flow south through
limited transmission capacity, while England‚Äôs southern regions remain
heavily dependent on imported electricity, both from abroad and further
north.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Unequal jobs/benefits</strong> - Much of rural England
struggles for quality, year-round jobs. By forcing more of the onshore
wind North of the Border, the Conservative Government robbed deprived
parts of the Westcountry, Pennines, Northumbria, and other windy regions
of England that could have benefited from wind farm development. This is
particularly problematic because the windiest parts of England tend to
be the poorest and most isolated‚Äîareas like Cornwall, the Pennines,
Northumberland, and parts of Yorkshire. These regions are typically:
<ul>
<li>Further from major cities and economic hubs</li>
<li>Lacking high-quality arable farmland (often only suitable for sheep
farming or marginal agriculture)</li>
<li>Struggling with depopulation and limited employment
opportunities</li>
<li>In need of economic development and infrastructure investment</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Wind farms could have provided these communities with construction
jobs, ongoing maintenance work, and annual payments to landowners‚Äîoften
the only significant income some of these areas see. Instead, these
benefits were concentrated in Scotland, leaving England‚Äôs windy but
economically deprived regions without this potential lifeline.</p>
<p>In contrast, many parts of rural Scotland have attracted large
numbers of engineers‚Äîboth working for the onshore wind developments and
for the grid infrastructure that facilitates them. Having a year-round
job with significant training and investment from a large employer is
often difficult to find in rural areas, but can offer a much more stable
quality of living to many rural people of working age. These skilled
positions provide not just employment, but career development
opportunities that are rare in isolated rural communities.</p>
<p>By keeping and indeed attracting new people of working age to an
area, this sort of development also helps to preserve other parts of the
social fabric such as keeping schools, shops, pubs, and medical
facilities open. Rural depopulation is a vicious cycle‚Äîas young people
leave for better opportunities elsewhere, local services close, making
the area even less attractive to families and businesses. Wind farm
development can break this cycle by providing stable, well-paid
employment that allows people to stay in their communities and support
local services. Energy related jobs also enable people to finance
mortgages and buy homes in rural areas. Without stable employment, many
rural communities become dominated by second homes, holiday lets, and
retirees, with few young families able to put down roots. Wind farm
development creates the economic foundation that allows working-age
people to build lives in rural communities rather than being forced to
move to cities for employment opportunities.</p>
<p>This creates a chicken and egg problem: because there are few
working-age people in rural areas to advocate for economic development
and renewable infrastructure, local politics becomes dominated by older,
close to retirement and retired people. These residents typically have
less focus on economic development‚Äîespecially job market expansion‚Äîand
more focus on preserving the asset value of their homes and maintaining
the ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù of their communities. Older residents naturally focus
more on the short-term disruption of construction rather than any longer
term benefits. This political dynamic makes it even harder to attract
the very development that could bring working-age people back, creating
a self-reinforcing cycle of rural decline.</p>
<p>This represents a clear tragedy of the commons failure: while each
local community rationally seeks to avoid hosting renewable energy
infrastructure (to preserve views, property values, and local
character), the collective result is a suboptimally low amount of
renewable energy deployment nationally. Without national coordination
and the ability to force through renewable infrastructure projects,
Britain will continue to fall short of its climate targets and energy
security needs, while individual communities remain trapped in cycles of
economic decline and political opposition to the very development that
could help them.</p>
<h2 id="marriage-of-mutual-convenience">Marriage of Mutual
Convenience</h2>
<p>Now fully part, at least financially of the GB power market,
investment in power generation in Scotland has boomed in the last 20
years. The two major renewables support schemes (ROCs and CfDs) collect
revenues a bit like taxes but instead as levies on electricity bills
across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The legal guarantee
of these subsidies or support is the key to unlocking private finance
that then pays the substantial upfront cost of building the windfarms
(and the associated grid infrastructure). Given the focus on wind energy
within the renewables push, even back in 2010 it was obvious that
Scotland was always going to punch above its weight in the national
generation mix. After all, Scotland only has about 10% of the UK‚Äôs
population. However, particularly with the onshore wind ban in England
in 2015, this only accelerated Scotland‚Äôs role as Britain‚Äôs renewable
energy powerhouse.</p>
<p>This has created a situation where Scotland receives substantial
renewable energy investment financed by British electricity consumers,
while the economic benefits - jobs, business rates, infrastructure
investment, and community development - are concentrated in Scottish
communities. The onshore wind ban in England has effectively made
Scotland the primary beneficiary of Britain‚Äôs renewable energy push.</p>
<p>What has emerged is an asymmetric relationship. Scottish renewables
projects are financed through levies on electricity bills across Great
Britain, meaning Scottish consumers do contribute to the costs - but
with Scotland representing only about 10% of Britain‚Äôs population, their
contribution is proportionally much smaller than the benefits they
receive. Scotland gets the lion‚Äôs share of investment in new
infrastructure, jobs, tax revenues, and substantial business rates from
renewable energy projects. For example, Highland Council alone receives
over ¬£20 million annually in business rates from renewable energy
projects, with some individual wind farms contributing ¬£500,000-¬£1
million each year to local council coffers. With a population of just
over 235,000 people, this represents around ¬£85 per person annually in
additional council revenue from renewable energy - a significant boost
for one of Britain‚Äôs most sparsely populated and economically challenged
regions.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a bit like all British billpayers (including Scots) agreeing to
a debt repayment surcharge on their electricity bills to concentrate
energy infrastructure projects in Scotland. While Scottish consumers pay
the same levies as everyone else, they represent only about 10% of the
total contributions but receive a much larger share of the local
economic benefits. The costs are spread across 67 million people, but
the local economic benefits - the new infrastructure, the jobs, the
business rates, the economic development - are concentrated in areas
with just a fraction of that population.</p>
<p>However, the size and scale of the investment would likely not have
been possible in a country the size of Scotland on its own. Having
access to the capital markets of the City of London and sterling
currency are equally essential to Scotland‚Äôs renewable energy boom. Had
Scotland (as it nearly did) voted for independence in 2014, or during a
later schism post-Brexit, unpicking the long-term contracts and
arrangements in the electricity infrastructure would have been one of
many thorny issues that would have had to have been negotiated. The
complex web of CfD contracts, transmission agreements, and cross-border
electricity trading arrangements would have created a legal and
financial nightmare for both sides.</p>
<p>In addition to pushing the investment north, this concentration also
requires more infrastructure to bring the energy 500 miles south to
where most of the demand is located. This in turn adds costs and
complexity to the grid, increases transmission losses, and creates more
political tension from NIMBY opposition to new pylons and transmission
lines. The very communities that rejected local wind farms are now being
asked to accept massive new transmission infrastructure to bring
Scottish wind power to southern markets.</p>
<p>Transmission losses over such distances are significant - typically
2-3% per 100 miles for high-voltage AC transmission, meaning 10-15% of
the energy generated in Scotland is lost before it reaches southern
markets. Even with modern high-voltage DC transmission used on undersea
bootstrap cables (which has lower losses of around 1-2% per 100 miles),
the 500-mile journey from the Highlands to London still results in 5-10%
energy losses. These losses represent not just wasted energy, but also
increased costs that are ultimately borne by all British electricity
consumers.</p>
<p>Such a dynamic was always going to happen to some extent between
urban and rural areas - cities need energy but can‚Äôt host large-scale
renewable projects, while rural areas have the space and resources but
limited local demand. However, the onshore wind ban in England has
exacerbated this natural tension by forcing a significant portion of the
development into Scotland rather than allowing for a more balanced
distribution across Britain‚Äôs rural areas.</p>
<p>This highlights a fundamental tension in Britain‚Äôs energy system that
was recently exposed by the rejected consideration of zonal electricity
pricing. The proposal would have created different electricity prices in
different regions based on local supply and demand, which would have
made electricity cheaper in Scotland (where there‚Äôs abundant wind
generation) and more expensive in southern England (where there‚Äôs high
demand but limited local generation). The rejection of this proposal
shows how politically difficult it is to address the geographic
imbalances that the current subsidy system has created - where Scottish
communities benefit from renewable energy development while English and
Welsh consumers pay the bills, but any attempt to reflect these real
costs and benefits in pricing is politically unpalatable.</p>
<h2 id="uk-diversification">UK Diversification</h2>
<p>When learning about investment portfolios, one of the first lessons
you learn is to reduce risk by diversifying. Certain assets decline
while others rise, smoothing out overall returns. There‚Äôs a direct
parallel with the distribution and location of wind farms around the
UK.</p>
<p>While some areas are outright windier than others (Scotland vs.¬†the
South East), the real benefit comes from geographic diversification. Not
just that, but often when it‚Äôs windy in one part of the country, it‚Äôs
less windy elsewhere. Much of our weather consists of fronts emerging
from the North Atlantic. Often these hit the northern part of Britain
(e.g., Scotland) harder, occasionally the south. Sometimes these fronts
hit the UK at a different angle, tracking from the south-west, west, or
north-west. And because wind speeds tend to be strongest around the line
of the weather front, there is almost always a timing lag between a
weather front hitting one part of the UK and the other.</p>
<p>Some weather systems move from west to east, others from south-west
to north-east, creating complex patterns where wind generation varies
significantly across different regions at different times. This
geographic and temporal variation means that a well-distributed
portfolio of wind farms across Britain would provide much more stable
and predictable generation than concentrating all capacity in just a few
areas.</p>
<p>The current concentration of wind farms in Scotland and the North Sea
creates a ‚Äúsingle point of failure‚Äù problem. When weather conditions are
unfavourable in those regions (which can happen for days or even weeks
during certain seasons), Britain‚Äôs renewable generation drops
dramatically. A diversified portfolio would include more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coastal wind farms</strong> in Cornwall, Devon, Wales and
Western Scotland (exposed to Atlantic weather systems)</li>
<li><strong>Upland wind farms</strong> in the Pennines and
Northumberland (benefiting from orographic effects - where wind is
forced upward by hills and mountains, creating higher wind speeds and
more consistent generation)</li>
<li><strong>Southern and eastern wind farms</strong> (catching different
weather patterns, especially in the Channel)</li>
</ul>
<p>This diversification would reduce the volatility of renewable
generation, decrease the need for expensive backup generation, and
improve Britain‚Äôs overall energy security. The onshore wind ban in
England has prevented this diversification, leaving Britain‚Äôs renewable
energy portfolio dangerously concentrated and vulnerable to regional
weather variations.</p>
<h2 id="european-diversification">European Diversification</h2>
<p>Even with a diversified UK portfolio of wind and solar assets, the UK
remains a relatively small country with a relatively confined climate.
Having access to trade electricity with the wider continent allows the
UK to benefit from changes in weather patterns over a much larger area,
exporting at times of surplus and importing surpluses elsewhere at times
of scarcity back home. As noted in <a
href="./16-brexit-friction.md">Chapter 16</a>, Brexit has introduced
extra friction to short-term electricity trading of the sort which is
particularly helpful in balancing renewables. However, the construction
of 5 new interconnectors since 2016 has thankfully still occurred
despite these challenges.</p>
<h2 id="fastforward-to-2025">Fastforward to 2025</h2>
<p>Taking its history into context, the challenges of making Scotland
the center piece or mecca of our energy system today, as we are trying
to make it, are enormous. Political history lessons can be boring and
sometimes seem a bit irrelevant, but it‚Äôs quite important to understand
just how much of a challenge or strain we‚Äôre putting on infrastructure
and organisational arrangements that simply weren‚Äôt set up for the
top-heavy, wind generation-focused system in the north of Scotland that
we are hoping to now get from our electricity system.</p>
<p>Until quite recently, the Highlands and Scotland were basically a
backwater - or a sideshow that was never conceived of or properly
integrated into Britain‚Äôs main electricity and energy system. The grid
was designed around serving the industrial heartlands of England, with
Scotland‚Äôs hydro schemes and later nuclear plants providing
supplementary generation rather than being central to the national
strategy. The idea that Scotland would become the powerhouse of
Britain‚Äôs renewable energy system would have seemed absurd to the
engineers and planners who built the original grid infrastructure.</p>
<p>Getting electricity from the Highlands to Southern England is, a bit
like the equivalent road/rail journey, a tortuous process from the
perspective of both physical and institutional geography. It requires
transmitting electricity through assets owned three different
transmission companies (SSE, Scottish Power, and National Grid). Indeed,
if the generation project is connected at lower voltage, it may also
involve the entirely (separate) distribution part of SSE. That‚Äôs a large
number of stakeholders, each of which has to be separately managed and
regulated. Each of these companies has different perspectives, cultures,
and financial objectives. If an investment fails to work out, it‚Äôs much
harder to hold any particular organisation accountable. Indeed, it‚Äôs
arguably simpler to bring power from the near continent (France,
Belgium, Netherlands) to the South East of England, and when you look at
the flows this is exactly what happens much of the time.</p>
<p>This fragmentation raises the question of whether Britain might need
to consider merging or reorganising its grid further - beyond the
National System Operator that the government recently created. While the
NESO was a step toward better coordination, the fundamental problem of
multiple transmission companies with different objectives and regulatory
frameworks remains. A truly unified transmission system might be
necessary to efficiently manage the north-south flows that Scotland‚Äôs
renewable energy boom requires.</p>
<h2 id="unexplored-solutions">Unexplored Solutions</h2>
<p>The extent of the transmission gap between the north of Scotland, the
Central belt and the rest of England and Wales is finally being
addressed. While the continued growth of renewables continues to put
more strain and set higher standards or move the goal posts up, by the
2030s it‚Äôs expected that many of the current issues will be in the past
assuming that grid upgrades go ahead as planned and expected. Other
accelerations for example the growth in grid scale battery storage and
smart grid technology could also have a rapid impact on what remains
quite an unsophisticated and unmanaged grid today.</p>
<p>That said there are a number of other levers which with correct
coordination the respective parts of government could start to
accelerate in a way that might receive political consent and mitigate or
at least buy time for the parts of the system which are struggling to
expand the transmission grid.</p>
<p>For example, the frequent surplus of electricity which Scotland faces
today could be addressed by an acceleration or concentration of the
growth of new demands for electricity there over the south of England.
Ruling out zonal or nodal pricing removed an important market signal
which could have achieved this automatically however there remain policy
levers which could affect this over time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Data centres</strong> - Despite higher land prices in the
south of England, data centre developers overwhelmingly choose locations
around London and the M4 corridor. While not every computing workload is
suitable for northern locations, the planning system could actively
encourage data centre projects further north by streamlining application
processes and reducing bureaucratic complexity. A similar argument could
be made for other electricity intensive forms of industry, including
manufacturing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air source heat pumps</strong> - Scotland has
historically provided more generous support for insulation and energy
efficiency measures compared to England and Wales. Using Westminster
funds, this support could be further extended to boost electricity
demand in Scotland and reduce transmission constraints on the national
grid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Electric vehicles</strong> - EV incentives are currently
identical across Scotland and the rest of Britain, with both offering
¬£350 grants for home chargers and similar vehicle grants. This could be
differentiated by exempting Scottish-registered vehicles from vehicle
excise duty, or exempting Scottish EV chargers from VAT. These measures
would accelerate EV adoption in Scotland and reduce transmission
constraints caused by excess power generation in the north.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The concentration of Britain‚Äôs renewable energy development in
Scotland, driven by the 2015 onshore wind ban in England, has created a
complex web of economic, political, and technical challenges. While
Scotland benefits from substantial investment and job creation, the
costs are spread across all British electricity consumers, creating an
asymmetric relationship that is difficult to address politically. The
resulting transmission constraints, energy losses, and lack of
geographic diversification leave Britain‚Äôs energy system vulnerable and
inefficient. Addressing these challenges will require both technical
solutions and political courage to overcome the NIMBY opposition that
created this situation in the first place.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-5-nuclear">Chapter 5: Nuclear</h1>
<h2 id="a-tale-of-two-countries">A tale of two countries</h2>
<p>France and Britain‚Äôs energy policies were remarkably similar until
the 1970s. Both countries had nationalised their electricity industries
after World War II, both relied heavily on coal for power generation,
and both were developing civilian nuclear programs. But when the 1973
oil crisis hit, their responses couldn‚Äôt have been more different.
France launched the ambitious Messmer Plan - a massive state-driven
program to shift almost entirely to nuclear power. Meanwhile, Britain‚Äôs
response was characteristically muddled.</p>
<p>What makes Britain‚Äôs failure even more striking is that it started
with a clear lead. The UK connected the world‚Äôs first commercial nuclear
power station, Calder Hall, to the grid in 1956; by the early 1960s it
had a fleet of Magnox reactors in operation and was exporting nuclear
expertise to countries like Italy and Japan.</p>
<p>France, by contrast, lagged the UK through the 1960s and only leapt
ahead after decisively committing to both improving energy
self-sufficiency and technical consolidation in the 1970s. The Messmer
Plan‚Äînamed after Prime Minister Pierre Messmer and launched in response
to the 1973 oil crisis‚Äîwas a bold national strategy that standardised on
pressurised water reactors (PWRs) and created a comprehensive domestic
supply chain. This single-minded focus on nuclear power would see France
build 56 reactors in just 15 years, while Britain stuck with a sequence
of bespoke designs (Magnox ‚Üí Advanced Gas‚Äëcooled Reactor ‚Üí the
never‚Äëcompleted Fast Breeder ‚Üí belated PWRs), each change resetting
learning curves, complicating procurement, and delaying delivery.</p>
<p>The discovery of North Sea oil and gas in the late 1960s had already
complicated Britain‚Äôs energy planning. Should the country double down on
nuclear power like France? Or rely on this new domestic fossil fuel
bounty? The result was policy paralysis. While France built 56 nuclear
reactors in just 15 years, Britain‚Äôs nuclear program became mired in
debates about reactor designs, locations, and costs. The contrast in
outcomes is stark: today nuclear provides over 70% of France‚Äôs
electricity at some of the lowest prices in Europe, while Britain‚Äôs
aging nuclear fleet supplies just 15%, is owned by the French state
supplier EdF and is mostly due for retirement.</p>
<p>That said, the French approach isn‚Äôt without long term challenges of
its own. Having built so many nuclear reactors so quickly, the French
grid effectively became saturated with nuclear energy. To find markets,
France had to expand interconnector cables with each of its 7
continental neighbours and Britain. When the saturation occurred in the
1980s and 1990s, France also had to stop building new nuclear reactors.
The massive, geographically mobile workforce and domestic supply chain
which had grown up around the nationwide attempt that built 56 nuclear
reactors in 15 years started to disintegrate. Talented workers went
elsewhere or retired. Intermediate suppliers ramped down production
facilities. In the years between 2022 when Civaux was finished and 2024
when Flamanville C was finished France didn‚Äôt open a single new nuclear
reactor. This important point is often ignored in British discourse
comparing energy policy on either side of the channel. However, with 14
nuclear reactors representing 14 GW of capacity expected to retire in
the 2030s, 22 GW in the 2040s and 20 GW in the 2050s, France now faces a
cliff edge. Life extensions to nuclear plants are commonplace and
substantial extensions are expected, inevitable and unlikely
controversial for safety. However, the technology which was supposed to
epitomise stability and self-sufficiency in energy production had
instead created a multi-generational boom-bust cycle.</p>
<p>Financially, the French approach is also laying the foundations for
longer term challenges. The investment in nuclear energy assumed a 0%
discount rate. Given the vast upfront and decomissioning costs of
nuclear power, there is a huge financial burden on future generations of
decommissioning and containing the nuclear waste. It‚Äôs quite difficult
to measure the lifetime (or lifecycle) cost of nuclear in terms that you
can compare to gas or other energy technologies. However, according to
the French energy regulator CRE‚Äôs 2022 estimate, the lifetime levelised
cost of electricity (LCOE) for French nuclear power is around 61 EUR/MWh
in 2022 prices (equivalent to approximately 67 EUR/MWh in current prices
after 3 years of inflation), while gas-fired electricity costs 40-80
EUR/MWh depending on gas prices and plant efficiency.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the French approach is stability. When
wholesale energy prices spiked in 2022, France should at least in theory
have been well placed to ride out the period of high prices. The cost of
nuclear power generation in the short-run is relatively low, nuclear
fuel costs only about 5-7 EUR/MWh generated compared with a peak of
500-600EUR/MWh in 2022. The value of nuclear exports should have
massively boosted France‚Äôs balance of trade and the trading results of
its state-owned electricity generator, EdF. And even if energy prices in
France were allowed to rise, to respect the country‚Äôs commitments to the
EU single energy market, there would be considerable tax revenue from
France‚Äôs energy companies, most significantly EdF to offset the cost of
any state support afforded to households and businesses.</p>
<p>However, EDF‚Äôs financial position has deteriorated significantly in
recent years. The company‚Äôs debt ballooned to over ‚Ç¨60 billion by 2022,
driven by the costs of maintaining France‚Äôs aging nuclear fleet and
extensive repairs over the years. The French government was forced to
fully renationalise EDF in 2022, buying out minority shareholders at a
cost of ‚Ç¨9.7 billion, reversing the privatisation of 15% of the company
in 2005. The liability for decommissioning France‚Äôs nuclear plants rests
with EDF, though the French state has created dedicated funds to cover
these costs. However, these provisions are widely regarded as
insufficient, with the French Court of Auditors estimating that EDF‚Äôs
nuclear decommissioning and waste management liabilities could reach ‚Ç¨74
billion - exceeding the company‚Äôs total market value and highlighting
the long-term financial burden that nuclear power places on the
state.</p>
<p>Compounding these financial problems, France didn‚Äôt see the expected
windfall from nuclear exports in 2022 for a number of reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear Fault</strong> - In 2022, France‚Äôs nuclear fleet was
operating at just 60% capacity due to widespread corrosion issues
discovered in key reactor components. This forced the shutdown of 32
reactors for safety inspections and repairs, dramatically reducing
France‚Äôs nuclear output and export potential.</p>
<p><strong>Hydro Drought</strong> - France‚Äôs second-largest electricity
source, hydroelectric power, was severely affected by drought conditions
across Europe. Reservoir levels fell to historic lows, cutting hydro
generation by 40% compared to normal years and forcing France to import
electricity rather than export it. Heatwave conditions also restricted
cooling water intake on some river sited nuclear plants for a whilte
too.</p>
<p>The combination of these two crises meant that France, normally
Europe‚Äôs largest electricity exporter, became a net importer for the
first time in decades. France imported 16 TWh of electricity in 2022 -
equivalent to the annual consumption of 4 million households. This
reversal from France‚Äôs typical 50 TWh annual exports contributed
significantly to Europe‚Äôs energy shortage during the Ukraine crisis,
pushing wholesale electricity prices to ‚Ç¨400/MWh in August 2022 - ten
times the pre-crisis average. For context, France‚Äôs annual electricity
consumption is around 450 TWh, in Britain it is 300 TWh. France‚Äôs sudden
need for gas-fired power from neighbouring countries like Britain, Italy
and the Netherlands had a particularly marked effect on prices. This
demand brought less efficient, peaking gas power stations into
operation, which due to marginal pricing forced up the cost of power
more generally in Europe.</p>
<h2 id="current-british-nuclear-programme">Current British nuclear
programme</h2>
<p>There are just 5 nuclear plants left online in Britain, each of which
is expected to close shortly:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Hartlepool</strong> - Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR),
1,190 MW capacity, expected closure 2026</li>
<li><strong>Heysham 1</strong> - AGR, 1,155 MW capacity, expected
closure 2026<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Heysham 2</strong> - AGR, 1,320 MW capacity, expected
closure 2028</li>
<li><strong>Torness</strong> - AGR, 1,360 MW capacity, expected closure
2028</li>
<li><strong>Sizewell B</strong> - Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR), 1,198
MW capacity, expected closure 2035</li>
</ol>
<p>All except Sizewell B are Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors built in the
1980s and early 1990s. Sizewell B is Britain‚Äôs only Pressurised Water
Reactor, built in the 1990s as a prototype for a wider PWR programme
that never materialised. Together, these plants currently generate about
15% of Britain‚Äôs electricity, down from a peak of around 25% in the
1990s.</p>
<h2 id="hinkley-point">Hinkley Point</h2>
<p>The vast new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C (3,200 MW) has been
under construction since the year 2017. When constructed it will be the
largest nuclear plant ever constructed in Britain. Hinkley Point C is an
EPR reactor; which</p>
<p>The construction has been a disaster. It was originally supposed to
open in 2023, but is now not expected until 2030 at the earliest. Every
year that its completion is delayed, the National Grid is without 3GW of
low carbon electricity, which is invariant to weather conditions and
reduces the need for gas generation and imports.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the cost of construction has also ballooned, from
an original estimate of ¬£16 billion to current projections of ¬£32-35
billion. Thankfully for the British taxpayer and billpayer, because of
the way the CfD contract is structured, EDF will be remunerated only
when the power station generates electricity. However, the negotiation
with EDF that took place before construction began guaranteed EDF a very
high price for Hinkley‚Äôs output; ¬£128/MWh in 2025 prices, which will
rise in line with inflation. This is slightly more expensive than the
latest expected costs for offshore wind (about ¬£116-117/MWh)</p>
<p>As noted above, this price is about double the average cost of EDF
generating nuclear power in France and is higher than the current UK
wholesale price, meaning it will be subsidised by billpayers. One could
even argue that the delay is saving customers money; at least until
power prices rise.</p>
<h2 id="more-nuclear-plants">More nuclear plants</h2>
<p>A follow-on nuclear project at Sizewell C has been announced by the
UK Government, replicacting about 85% of the EPR design from Hinkley
Point. As with Hinkley Point, by using an existing nuclear site, it is
hoped that the local population will be more amenable to the project,
recruiting staff with the right skills will be easier, and there will be
an existing grid connection to use.</p>
<p>The financing model for Sizewell C is called RAB (Regulated Asset
Base) and is the opposite of Hinkley Point; the taxpayer/billpayer will
finance and take on the risk of construction. EDF was relucant,
especially after Hinkley Point to repeat the CfD arrangement. RAB
(Regulated Assset Base) is the same as the water industry and some other
privatised monopoly utilities.</p>
<p>If lessons are learnt from Hinkley Point, it‚Äôs feasible that Sizewell
C could end up being cheaper or at least that not much more expensive
than Hinkley Point. Hinkley Point the first in a generation nuclear
project in Britain, and the first time and EPR reactor had been built in
the UK. If some savings passed through to Sizewell C, the billpayers
would benefit from the savings, unlike the CfD arrangement where savings
would accrue to EDF.</p>
<p>However, underspend on nuclear plants is not the norm! And
substantial increases in interest rates since 2012 (when they were close
to zero), mean that with the best engineering advances, it‚Äôs much more
likely that, should things go wrong at Sizewell that billpayers will end
up paying for any increases in the budget and suffer the consequences of
any delays to the generation of power from it.</p>
<p>Bloomberg New Energy Finances has recently estimated the cost of
Sizewell C‚Äôs power in levelised cost terms (a sort of average NPV or net
present value) at ¬£286/MWh; which is extremely high. It‚Äôs no surprise
perhaps that EDF is choosing ditch the EPR and build a lower price
simpler reactor for the 6 new projects it intends to build in France by
2038. However, this begs the question whether the UK is wise to continue
using the combination of EDF and the existing EPR design.</p>
<h2 id="is-nuclear-reliable">Is nuclear reliable?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the strongest argument for nuclear power is its
supposed reliability. Compared to the main low carbon alternatives (wind
and solar), nuclear is ‚Äúdispatchable‚Äù, you can control the if a nuclear
reaction is to take place and the amount of power that‚Äôs produced.
Unless a drought prevents a nuclear plant getting cooling water, you‚Äôre
generally not affected by weather, and a nuclear plant is designed to
run 80% of the time, with planned outages just for maintainence.</p>
<p>More recently, this reliability has come into serious doubt for two
reasons:</p>
<h3 id="construction-delays">Construction Delays</h3>
<p>Every nuclear plant built in Europe in the last 25 years has been
severely delayed and over budget. France‚Äôs Flamanville 3 (1,650 MW) was
under construction from 2007 to 2024 - 12 years later than originally
planned, with costs escalating from ‚Ç¨3.3 billion to ‚Ç¨19.1 billion
(‚Ç¨11,600/MW). After finally opening in 2024, it was immediately shut
down due to technical issues and operational problems. Finland‚Äôs
Olkiluoto 3 (1,600 MW) took 18 years to build (2005-2023) and cost ‚Ç¨11
billion compared to the original ‚Ç¨3 billion estimate (‚Ç¨6,900/MW).
Britain‚Äôs Hinkley Point C (3,200 MW) is currently projected at ‚Ç¨37-41
billion versus an original ‚Ç¨19 billion estimate (‚Ç¨11,600-13,000/MW).
Hungary‚Äôs Paks 2 project (2,400 MW) was originally planned for ‚Ç¨12.5
billion but has been suspended due to escalating costs. The pattern is
clear: nuclear construction in Europe averages 10-15 year delays and
3-6x cost overruns, with final costs of ‚Ç¨7,000-13,000/MW.</p>
<p>An incomplete nuclear plant is useless. Not only do they not generate
any power, but given the scale of investment involved, grid planners
need to know with reasonable certainty when a nuclear-sized plant will
be available. If it isn‚Äôt, they must make provision for alternative firm
capacity, as Britain is doing for Hinkley Point, which was supposed to
be the largest power plant on our grid by 2023. The knock-on effects of
nuclear delays ripple through the entire energy system - when a 3.2 GW
nuclear plant is delayed, it affects grid planning, energy security,
carbon targets, and consumer bills across the country. The absence of
Hinkley Point C is particularly problematic because it would have
generated over 3 GW of power in the South West, a region that already
lacks adequate transmission capacity to import power from the North and
East of England. A construction delay at a medium-sized onshore wind
farm might cost a few hundred megawatts and be relatively easy to
compensate for, but nuclear delays create system-wide planning
challenges. In reality, we‚Äôre fortunate that Britain has existing gas
plants that can be kept in service rather than needing to build entirely
new capacity to replace the delayed nuclear plant. However, it‚Äôs worth
noting that construction delays for wind (even offshore), battery
storage, solar, and gas plants are much lower and more predictable than
nuclear. This reliability in planning and delivery makes these
technologies far more valuable to grid operators than nuclear power.</p>
<h3 id="unscheduled-outages">Unscheduled Outages</h3>
<p>The French nuclear outages in 2022 occurred when a common fault was
identified that affected a large number of reactors. These were the
Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) type, specifically the 1300 MW and 1450
MW models, and 32 reactors were built between 1980 and 2000 with the
same design flaw - stress corrosion cracking in the emergency cooling
system piping.</p>
<p>French nuclear plants also suffer frequent strike-related outages,
with EDF workers regularly walking out over pay disputes, pension
reforms, and working conditions, further undermining the reliability
that nuclear power is supposed to provide. While UK nuclear workers are
unionised and have the legal right to strike, their track record of
industrial action is relatively limited compared to France - though
wildcat strikes at Sellafield and Heysham in 2009 showed the potential
for disruption.</p>
<p>Were Britain to replicate the French model and build a large number
of identical nuclear plants, it might achieve economies of scale and
reduce nuclear costs closer to French levels of 60EUR/MWh, which are
about half the cost of Hinkley Point. However, this approach would
expose Britain to the same systemic risk that France experienced in
2022, where a single design flaw could simultaneously take out a
significant portion of the entire nuclear fleet. The critical difference
with nuclear power is that faults cannot be ignored or tolerated -
unlike gas turbines or wind turbines, nuclear reactors must be
immediately shut down when safety issues are discovered, regardless of
the economic consequences.</p>
<h2 id="small-modular---a-potential-way-out">Small Modular - a potential
way out</h2>
<p>Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have been touted as a potential
solution to Britain‚Äôs nuclear construction problems. Unlike traditional
nuclear plants built on-site with bespoke designs, SMRs are designed to
be manufactured in factories and assembled on-site, with proponents
claiming this approach could reduce costs and construction times through
standardisation. The government has already committed ¬£210 million to
the SMR design competition and a further ¬£157 million to support
Rolls-Royce‚Äôs SMR programme, despite no SMRs yet being built
commercially anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Proponents suggest factory-built reactors could achieve levelised
costs of electricity (LCOE) of around ¬£60-80/MWh - significantly below
Hinkley Point‚Äôs ¬£128/MWh - though these are theoretical estimates based
on untested technology. The modular approach could potentially open up
distributed deployment options that traditional nuclear cannot match,
such as powering individual industrial complexes or data centres.
Rolls-Royce brings submarine reactor experience to this market, and
while they sold off their civilian nuclear business to Westinghouse in
the early 2000s, they do have extensive civilian power generation
expertise through their aero-derivative gas turbines, which are widely
used in power plants worldwide.</p>
<p>While this is definitely one to watch, and if it works out could be a
technology that Britain could export globally, the track record of
nuclear construction in Europe suggests that theoretical advantages
often fail to materialise in practice. However, given the downsides of
centralised nuclear at Hinkley Point and elsewhere, modular reactors
merit further attention and investment.</p>

<h1
id="chapter-8-regional-privatisation-model---how-fragmentation-hurts">Chapter
8: Regional Privatisation Model - How Fragmentation Hurts</h1>
<h2 id="pre-privatisation">Pre-privatisation</h2>
<p>Prior to privatisation in the 1990s, the electricity system in
Britain comprised of:</p>
<p>‚Äì <strong>CEGB</strong>: transmission grid and all power stations ‚Äì
<strong>Regional Electricity Boards</strong>: local distribution cables
and retail (tariffs, billing etc) - there were 12 in total ‚Äì
<strong>Scotland</strong>: 2 verticallly integrated power companies</p>
<p>The decision to privatise is well doumented elsewhere. One of the
main objectives was to create retail competition as a downward pressure
on prices. However there were a number of issues:</p>
<p>__ <strong>Existing integration</strong>: the regional grids were
integrated with the local retail operations ‚Äì <strong>Barriers to
entry</strong>: enticing completely new entrants to a new market seemed
unlikely</p>
<h2 id="privatisation">Privatisation</h2>
<p>So as a privatisation roadmap in 1990, the decision was taken to:</p>
<p>‚Äì Preserve separate network companies in each region. Though
eventually these were allowed to merge with each other and share some
management functions, the 12 (14 including Scotland) regions are still
largely regulated separately. ‚Äì Allow each of the regional companies
over time to compete outside their existing area.</p>
<p>The world has changed a lot since 1990. Back then, having regional
organisations made a lot more sense, but this is much less true today
because of:</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>In 1990, regional electricity companies were installing, maintaining
and manually reading electricity meters, creating quarterly bills and
taking cash/cheque payments. Aside from field engineers, many of their
employees were clerical, working in regional call centres. They had no
technology platforms (websites, apps) - systems that have largely fixed
costs but can scale to any number of users. Marketing wasn‚Äôt a priority,
there was no need to attract/win over customers, there were a handful of
tariffs. With no switching, the volume of customers joining or leaving
the supplier was much smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucratisation</strong></p>
<p>The cost of management and administration has soared. Executive pay
at Distribution Network Operators has increased dramatically since 1990
- from around ¬£50,000-80,000 for senior managers in the public sector
Regional Electricity Boards to ¬£500,000-¬£2 million for CEOs of today‚Äôs
DNOs. Even accounting for inflation (where ¬£1 in 1990 is worth about
¬£2.50 today), this represents a real increase of 2.5x to 16x in
executive compensation. The broader cost of management, administration,
and corporate overhead has grown from around 5-8% of total costs in 1990
to 15-20% today. This is because having a privatised structure creates
more executive and management jobs at the government regulator (Ofgem),
as well as an army of consultants and accountants that support the
marathon price control process. Every few years, companies negotiate
with regulators and are eventually told how much, as monopolies, they
are allowed to charge customers. Having 14 regional areas means this
process and cost is replicated 14 times.</p>
<p><strong>Outdated Remuneration</strong></p>
<p>Under privatisation, network companies get a guaranteed return on
capital for every pound of assets, be it pylons, substations or
pipelines. Given this, the assumption is that left to their own devices,
the network company will want to invest more than is strictly necessary,
and that the regulator is therefore required to limit their expenditure,
which they do within the price control.</p>
<p>To be fair, this process can work quite neatly when not much is
changing. The budgeting process takes last year‚Äôs figures as a starting
point, and the main action each year is that some assets nearing the end
of their working life get replaced, an inflation increase is applied,
and companies get some productivity targets. This was broadly the world
that existed up until the 2010s, but since then we‚Äôve been radically
departing from this stable model for the following reasons:</p>
<h2 id="peak-gas">Peak Gas</h2>
<p>Gas currently reaches around 85-90% of British homes. Until recently,
it was the standard assumption that new build homes and particularly
houses would have a gas connection. The expected move to heat pumps
means this is no longer the case, and as existing homes start the
process of retrofitting heat pumps, over time fewer and fewer homes will
have a gas connection. However, as this process isn‚Äôt co-ordinated, gas
network companies are in most places still going to have to maintain a
similar mileage of network but with fewer customers, at least for the
time being.</p>
<p>This creates a fundamental problem with the privatised network model.
From the Government, consumer, and environment‚Äôs perspective it makes
sense over time to abandon the gas network. However, from the
perspective of a privatised gas network company, the incentive is to
maximise the returns from the assets they have for the longest potential
period. At the moment, for example, they have a particularly strong
incentive to replace any infrastructure (such as any remaining old steel
pipes) with new plastic ones, as this will get from the regulator a
guaranteed return on these new assets for 15-25 years.</p>
<p>The regional structure compounds this problem. With 8 regional gas
networks, each facing similar challenges, there‚Äôs no coordinated
approach to managing the decline. Each company fights to maintain its
customer base and asset value, even when the overall system would
benefit from economies of scale. The result is likely to be higher costs
for remaining customers and slower progress toward net zero, as the
privatised model prioritises shareholder returns over system
efficiency.</p>
<p>Worse still, this legacy burden is likely to fall most acutely on
poorer households that are slower to embrace heat pumps and other
low-carbon technologies. As wealthier households transition away from
gas, the remaining customers will face higher bills to maintain the same
network infrastructure. This creates a regressive effect where the costs
of the energy transition are borne disproportionately by those least
able to afford them, while the benefits accrue to those who can afford
to upgrade their heating systems first.</p>
<h2 id="demand-electrification">Demand Electrification</h2>
<p>The local electricity distribution cables for a typical residential
home with gas heating were designed to support diversity demand from
each house of around 1-2 kW. As the lifetime of cables and substations
is around 40-50 years, the average age of kit out there was designed
over 20-30 years ago. An EV charger of the size typically recommended
uses 7 kW, which is 3-7 times more than the original diversity demand
capacity. A heat pump in a typical home might use 2-3 kW in peak winter
times in addition. If one or two homes in a street get these upgrades,
the network can typically cope and gradually expand. But if there are
concentrated pockets (e.g., where neighbours copy each other), then this
can create problems for network companies.</p>
<p>This problem is also exacerbated by the use of single-phase (instead
of three-phase) electricity supplies in the UK, because homes can only
draw power from one phase of the distribution network, concentrating
demand on individual cables rather than spreading it across three
phases. If the houses in a street that have upgraded to heat pumps and
EVs happen to share the same phase of the three phases supplied to the
street, then the network company may have to undertake expensive cable
upgrades even if only a minority of houses on the street have made these
upgrades.</p>
<p>This creates a fundamental problem with the privatised model. Left to
their own devices, network companies would want to rewire everything
with expensive physical upgrades to handle the new demand. However, in
reality there is a range of smart technologies - from dynamic load
management and smart inverters to battery storage and demand response
systems - that can avoid or at least delay many network upgrades. The
regulatory price control process, designed to prevent over-investment,
now acts as a barrier to the rapid expansion needed for net zero.</p>
<p>The regional structure compounds this problem. While the government
and Ofgem claim there is a coordinated approach through various
strategies and investment frameworks, the reality is more fragmented.
With 14 separate electricity distribution networks, each facing similar
electrification challenges, coordination remains limited. Each company
makes investment decisions based on local regulatory incentives rather
than national energy transition needs. The result is likely to be slower
electrification progress, higher costs from piecemeal upgrades, and a
system that prioritises regulatory compliance over strategic network
development.</p>
<h2 id="debt">Debt</h2>
<p>The privatised structure has also led to concerning trends in
leverage and gearing across Britain‚Äôs network companies. Electricity and
gas distribution companies have increasingly loaded up on debt, with
gearing ratios (debt to equity) rising from 20-30% pre-privatisation to
60-70% in the early 2010s to 80-90% today. This strategy was made
possible by the prolonged period of low interest rates following the
2008 financial crisis, which made high leverage financially attractive.
This mirrors the pattern seen in water companies, where high leverage
was used to extract dividends and reduce tax bills, creating what became
known as ‚Äúfinancial engineering‚Äù rather than real operational
efficiency. This shift has also changed the financial risk profile of
Britain‚Äôs energy infrastructure, making it more vulnerable to interest
rate fluctuations and market volatility.</p>
<p>Since 2022, this high leverage has become a major problem. Rising
interest rates have dramatically increased the cost of servicing this
debt, with many companies now facing interest costs that are 2-3 times
higher than they were just a few years ago. The regulator‚Äôs response has
been to allow these higher financing costs to be passed through to
consumers, but this creates a vicious cycle where higher bills reduce
demand, which increases the per-customer cost burden, leading to even
higher bills.</p>
<h2 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h2>
<p>The fundamental problem with Britain‚Äôs regional privatisation model
is that it was designed for a stable, predictable world that no longer
exists. The energy transition requires rapid, coordinated change across
the entire system, but the current structure creates perverse incentives
that work against this goal.</p>
<p>Network companies are incentivised to maximise returns on existing
assets rather than facilitate the transition to net zero. The fragmented
regional structure prevents coordinated strategic planning. High
leverage makes companies vulnerable to interest rate shocks and creates
pressure to pass costs through to consumers. And the regulatory
framework, designed to prevent over-investment in a stable world, now
acts as a barrier to the rapid expansion needed for decarbonisation.</p>
<p>One potential solution is to create a single national distribution
system operator. This would deliver significant advantages over the
current fragmented model, and would bring Britain in line with
international best practice. While Britain has 14 distribution companies
for a population of 67 million, France has just one main operator
(Enedis) serving 95% of the country‚Äôs 68 million people. Other European
countries with similar populations, such as Spain and Italy, also have
far fewer distribution companies than Britain. The UK‚Äôs fragmentation is
particularly striking given its relatively small geographic size and
population.</p>
<p><strong>Elimination of False Competition</strong>: The current 14
regional companies don‚Äôt actually compete with each other - they operate
as separate monopolies. A single national company would eliminate this
artificial fragmentation while maintaining the benefits of private
sector efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Efficiencies</strong>: A single company could
standardise systems, processes, and equipment across all regions,
reducing costs and improving reliability. Staff and resources could be
moved between regions as needed, both for normal operations and
emergency response to storms or other disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Simplification</strong>: Instead of 14 separate
price control processes, there would be just one. This would eliminate
the need for 14 sets of management teams, consultants, and accountants,
dramatically reducing the bureaucratic overhead that has grown from 5-8%
to 15-20% of total costs.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Coordination</strong>: A single company could
develop truly national strategies for the energy transition, rather than
14 separate approaches that may conflict or duplicate effort. This would
be particularly valuable for managing the electrification of heat and
transport.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Benefits</strong>: A larger, more diversified
company would likely benefit from lower cost of capital and reduced
financing costs, as investors would see lower risk from geographic and
operational diversification.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation and Technology</strong>: A single company could
develop unified IT systems, smart grid technologies, and demand response
markets that work consistently across the country, making it easier for
innovative companies to participate. This is particularly important
today, as the energy transition requires sophisticated digital
technologies, smart meters, electric vehicle charging networks, and
demand response systems that work seamlessly across the entire country.
In the 1990s, when the regional model was designed, such technologies
didn‚Äôt exist - electricity distribution was largely a matter of
maintaining physical infrastructure. Today‚Äôs challenges require national
coordination and standardization that the fragmented regional model
cannot provide.</p>
<p><strong>The Ownership Problem</strong>: The current 14 distribution
companies are owned by a complex mix of shareholders, including British
pension funds, foreign state-owned enterprises, and private equity
funds. Some are owned by single foreign entities, while others have
diverse shareholder bases. Any attempt to create a single national
operator would require either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negotiated acquisition</strong> of all 14 companies, which
would be extremely expensive and fraught with disputes over valuation,
particularly given the guaranteed returns these companies enjoy under
the current regulatory regime</li>
<li><strong>Compulsory purchase</strong> through nationalisation, which
would face legal challenges and political opposition, especially from
foreign investors and their governments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Cost Challenge</strong>: The combined market value of
Britain‚Äôs distribution companies runs into tens of billions of pounds.
Any government attempting to acquire these assets would face enormous
upfront costs, even if the long-term benefits of a single operator were
clear. The political and financial risks of such a transaction would be
substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Approaches</strong>: Given these challenges, more
incremental reforms might be more politically feasible. This could
include greater coordination between existing companies, shared services
agreements, or the creation of a national planning body that could
direct investment priorities across all regions. However, these
approaches would likely deliver only a fraction of the benefits that a
truly unified system could provide.</p>
<p>The regional privatisation model that seemed sensible in 1990 has
become a barrier to the changes needed in 2024 and beyond. But
overcoming this barrier will require confronting the difficult political
and financial realities of unwinding three decades of privatisation.</p>

Smart Meters Optional - Why the Rollout Failed</h1>
<p>The UK smart meter rollout is unparalleled in its failure, and what‚Äôs
most surprising is how few people know just how bad we are compared to
similar countries. To put this in perspective, the smart meter rollout
has cost taxpayers and billpayers over ¬£13 billion - more than the
London 2012 Olympics (¬£8.8 billion), approaching the cost of Hinkley
Point C nuclear power station (¬£25-30 billion), and a significant
fraction of the HS2 rail project (¬£100+ billion). Yet unlike these other
major infrastructure projects, the smart meter rollout affects 20-30
million homes and businesses across the entire country, making it one of
the most widespread government programmes ever attempted. This works out
to an average cost of around ¬£500-650 per home or business - a
substantial sum that has been added to everyone‚Äôs energy bills. Despite
this massive scale and cost, regulatory and bureaucratic blunders mean
we aren‚Äôt getting the return on investment we should from it.</p>
<p>As of 2025, after 16 years and ¬£13 billion, the UK has achieved just
67% completion - meaning one in three homes still lacks a smart meter.
Even more concerning, of the 39 million smart meters installed, 3.9
million are not functioning in full smart mode due to connectivity
issues or technical problems. This means the actual functional
completion rate is even lower than the headline figure suggests.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why it has been so expensive is that it has gone
on for such a long time. Indeed, it‚Äôs gone on for so long that the
original minister who agreed to the smart meter rollout back in 2009 was
Ed Miliband - a reminder of just how many governments and energy
ministers have presided over this project without managing to complete
it. The extended timeline has allowed costs to escalate dramatically,
with each delay and restart adding millions to the final bill. The irony
is that Miliband is now back in the same job as Energy Secretary, having
returned to the department where he launched this troubled project 16
years ago.</p>
<p>To understand the root of the problems, it‚Äôs important to understand
some of the mistakes made during the privatisation of our energy market,
which are explained in further detail in Chapter 8. The smart meter
rollout‚Äôs failures are not isolated incidents but symptoms of deeper
structural problems in how Britain‚Äôs energy system was designed and
regulated.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, the government decided on a complex ownership model for
smart meters. It was felt that electricity suppliers (retailers) should
own as much as possible of the relationship with energy customers. At
the same time, it was decided that meter ownership should be outsourced
to a separate group of competing private companies that could own and
operate them as infrastructure assets. This was seen as preferable to
the previous arrangement, where regional electricity companies had
maintained and owned meters, or to the approach used in other countries
like France, Germany, and the Netherlands, where meters continue to be
owned and operated by the network companies. It was also felt that there
were significant benefits to having smart meters for gas (as well as
electricity), and given that many customers had ‚Äúdual fuel‚Äù energy
contracts with the same supplier for electricity and gas that by putting
suppliers in charge, this would enable synergies between electricity and
gas. This feeling was held strongly by energy companies with lots of gas
customers, who felt it might make it more difficult and expensive to
sell gas.</p>
<p>The theory was that this model, where electricity suppliers appoint
meter companies to install meters on their behalf, would make it easier
for customers to switch between suppliers in the competitive retail
market. Suppliers could simply transfer the meter lease from one
metering company to another when a customer changed providers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every electricity and gas supplier (there are x operating in the
market today) have had to build and maintain their own departments,
systems and platforms to procure install and maintain smart meters</li>
<li>Appointments have to be per customer, not per street.</li>
<li>Gas meters are often separate from electricity meters. Old gas
meters don‚Äôt need an electricity supply, and so there is often not an
electricity supply to connect a smart gas meter to.</li>
<li>Whenever a smart meter is installed and there is a wider problem
with the electricity supply coming into the property, the metering
company and supplier then have to negotiate with the electricity network
anyway. It also removes accountability from a single company for the
smart meter rollout.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there are broader problems too:</p>
<p><strong>Pandering to conspiracy theorists</strong></p>
<p>A niche group of energy consumers believe that smart meters have
publicly unacknowledged downsides, such as affecting human health or
facilitating some dystopian or Orwellian future. To placate such groups,
the Government built in safeguards to allow energy consumers the right
to opt out of smart meter installation. However, this opt-out provision
has created additional complexity and cost, as suppliers must maintain
separate systems for customers with traditional meters while also
ensuring that the smart meter network can still function effectively.
The irony is that these conspiracy theories, while unfounded, have
actually contributed to the rollout‚Äôs failure by creating a system
that‚Äôs more complex and expensive than it needed to be.</p>
<p>Moreover, until recently, suppliers were generally not allowed to
offer cheaper tariffs specifically to smart meter customers, as this
could be seen as discriminatory against those who have opted out or
cannot have smart meters installed. This meant that one of the key
benefits of smart meters - the ability to offer more sophisticated and
potentially cheaper time-of-use tariffs - could not be used to
incentivize adoption, further undermining the business case for the
rollout. However, this has started to change with the emergence of EV,
heat pump, and battery tariffs that do require smart meters, though
these remain a small fraction of the market.</p>
<p><strong>Gas smart meters never made sense</strong></p>
<p>As a country, we‚Äôre moving away from gas. It makes little sense to
make such a colossal investment in our gas system. Unlike electricity,
where smart meters allow for more accurate measurement of when power is
used and therefore enable time-of-use tariffs for the first time - thus
helping cut costs and accelerate the transition to renewables - it
matters much less when gas is used. While gas demand peaks in the
evening and morning (similar to electricity), there is so much storage
capacity in the gas network (called ‚Äúlinepack‚Äù) that there is no benefit
to measuring half-hourly gas usage in the same way as electricity.</p>
<p>The practical challenges of gas smart metering are even more
significant. Gas meters are often located in different places to
electricity meters - typically in cellars, garages, or external meter
boxes. A large part of the cost of smart metering for gas involves
establishing communication links between the electricity meter and the
gas meter, either through wireless connections or new cabling. If this
isn‚Äôt practical, then gas meters might still need to be read manually
(either by the consumer or the energy company), which negates most of
the benefits of smart metering.</p>
<p>When the EU mandated that all member states install smart meters,
they specifically excluded gas meters for precisely these reasons. The
UK, making this decision while it was still an EU member, decided to go
much further and gold-plate the regulatory requirement. This was a
classic case of regulatory overreach - taking a sensible EU requirement
and making it unnecessarily complex and expensive.</p>
<p>Even if the lack of smart metering for gas had led to an accelerated
move towards electricity for heating, this would have been
environmentally beneficial, even though it would have been undesirable
for energy companies that supply gas.</p>
<p><strong>Network connectivity</strong> Smart meters send really tiny
amounts of data, back to electricity companies, in substance it‚Äôs a
single number telling them how many kilowatt hours is used every half
hour. Meters need something similar to an internet connection to send
this information back. The most obvious way to do this would be over
mobile phone networks, where the volume of data would be trivial
compared to modern 5G smart phone browsing. The obvious fall back in
areas lacking a phone signal from at least one of the mobile networks
would probably be to drop into the home wifi connection, in the same way
many of our other devices (Smart TV, Doorbell, Printer etc) do. For the
very few homes that lack both mobile connection and wifi (which would be
tiny), then there are satellite and radio options which could work
out.</p>
<p>What the Government instead decided to do was to split the country
into two regions. First, Government divided the country between the
North and South along a line roughly between Liverpool and Leeds. So all
of Scotland and part of Northern England falls in a northern region,
while the rest of England and Wales falls into a southern region. For
the southern region, the Government handed an exclusive contract to O2
(Telefonica) to use their existing mobile network. For the Northern
region, the Government handed an exclusive contract to Arqiva for a
solution based on longer distance radio signals. The thinking was that
this would suit the more rural topography of Scotland and Northern
England, and the denser population further south. However, this approach
has proven too broad-brush and problematic:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the Northern region, Arqiva‚Äôs radio solution doesn‚Äôt work as
well in urban areas. It‚Äôs based on radio technology originally designed
for use by the emergency services in rural areas by vehicles with big
aerials, where there is a low density of devices. Urban electricity and
gas meters are clustered together in basements or alleyways. And even in
Scotland and the North of England, the majority of the population is
urbanised. The decision to award an exclusive contract to Arqiva for
these areas also prevents energy suppliers falling back to use O2, even
though in most built up areas, a mobile signal would be readilly
available.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Southern region, many rural areas originally lack an O2
signal, but did have coverage from Vodafone/EE/Three. The most remote
places would probably have been better suited to Arqiva‚Äôs technology. In
any case, this led to many situations where smart meters either couldn‚Äôt
be installed or worked unreliably. This situation has in recent years
with the merger of O2 with Vodafone, a separate fallover contract for
smart meters with Vodafone and a Shared Rural Network programme where in
the most rural areas, all network companies share
infrastructure.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Inhome Displays versus Mobile Apps</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, when the smart meter rollout began, the iPhone was 2 years
old and mobile apps were nowhere near as ubiquitous as today, especially
with older and more vulnerable households e.g.¬†pensioners. The decision
was therefore taken to mandate energy suppliers provide customers with
an in-home screen device (IHD) to present live and summary information
from the smart meter.</p>
<p>This added significantly to the cost because they are a separate
piece of hardware that needs to be user friendly and have a power
supply. To be diplomatic, the IHDs which energy suppliers eventually
procured are of variable quality and ease of use to the average
customer. If IHDs break, energy suppliers have to replace them which can
be quite frequent in tenanted properties. IHDs also use energy (albeit
small amounts), for negligible benefit to most consumers.</p>
<p>In 2025, the growth of smartphones, tablets and computers as well as
the accessibility improvements which have happened to them makes the
continued requirement for an in home display (IHD) verging on the
absurd.</p>
<p><strong>A network rollout makes infinitely more sense</strong>
Connecting all the previous downsides, the overarching mistake
Government made was not to consolidate smart meter rollout to
electricity network companies. This was the approach taken in most other
European countries, including Italy (99% completion), Sweden (95%
completion), Finland (90% completion), France (85% completion), and
Ireland (80% completion), where the rollout of smart meters is
significantly more complete than the UK‚Äôs current 67% completion rate.
Even more damning, the UK‚Äôs functional completion rate is even lower
when accounting for the 3.9 million smart meters that aren‚Äôt working
properly. Had the Government taken a network rollout approach, we‚Äôd have
made much better progress, at a lower cost, with greater reliability and
a better consumer experience. As noted in <a
href="./08-regional-privatisation.md">Chater 8</a>, a single national
network operator might implement such a technology rollout even
better.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-10-electricity-levies---hidden-costs-everywhere">Chapter
10: Electricity Levies - Hidden Costs Everywhere</h1>
<p>In the UK, there‚Äôs been considerable interest of late in high energy
prices. While generally true, the reality is more mixed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The standard cost of electricity per kilowatt hour is about 25p
and is similar for business and residential consumers. This is expensive
by international standards, especially for businesses, though not that
expensive by European levels and for the residential sector.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard cost of gas per kilowatt hour is much lower, at
about 7p. This is relatively cheap by international standards,
particularly for residential consumers, though business gas prices are a
bit higher because of extra environmental and carbon charges that they
face.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are quite a few reasons why British energy users have such
mixed fortunes:</p>
<p><strong>Reliance on Gas for Electricity</strong> The UK is
particularly dependent on gas not just for heating, but also to generate
electricity. Unlike France, Britain has much less nuclear power. Outside
Scotland, Britain lacks the geography for much hydro power, at least
compared to the Nordics, Alpine countries, Spain or Canada. And compared
to Germany, Poland, US, China and India, Britain shifted entirely from
coal power, which used to generate nearly all our electricity.</p>
<p>Gas produces about half the CO2 emissions per unit of electricity
generated (around 400g CO2/kWh) compared to coal (around 800g CO2/kWh).
Even though the UK had well established gas fields in the North Sea, it
was considered a premium fuel for heating and industry, and the CEGB
(Central Electricity Generating Board) had limited gas-fired generation
capacity before privatisation, preferring coal for electricity
production. However, there were significant advances in gas turbine
technology at power stations in the 1980s and 1990s, and it was cheaper
and easier to build new gas-fired power stations. Combined cycle gas
power stations (CCGTs) became the preference for newly privatised energy
companies, and between 1990 and 2010, around 30 major CCGT plants were
built around the UK in a ‚Äúdash for gas‚Äù.</p>
<p>Investment in new nuclear plants basically stopped after the
completion of Sizewell in the 1990s, which had been initiated before
privatisation, but which dragged on and was massively overbudget. Given
the scale and long term risk of nuclear investment, coupled with cheap
gas and wholesale power prices privatised utilities were unable and
unwilling to invest in new nuclear plants, and the existing plants which
were privatised eventually went bankrupt and were sold to the French
state utility EdF.</p>
<p>The wholesale price mechanism used in Britain sets the price of
electricity at the cost of the most expensive power generator in each
half hourly period. 98% of the time, this is a gas power station. And so
wholesale electricity prices in Britain closely shadow gas prices,
although there is considerable movement from day to day and hour to hour
depending on the level of demand. This is because the most efficient gas
power stations in Britain, like the newer CCGT plants, are around 55-60%
efficient, while the least efficient gas power stations (often older,
simpler gas turbines) are more like 30-35% efficient. This means that
the cost of making a unit of electricity at the least efficient gas
power stations is maybe double that at the most efficient ones. In turn,
this means that the least efficient power stations operate very little,
typically only firing up on very cold days midwinter and for the peak
late-afternoon and evening periods when demand is highest and all
available capacity is needed to keep the lights on. And when the least
efficient plants do have to fire up, prices spike!</p>
<p>After 2010, there was a notable increase in wind energy investment,
which now contributes a similar share % as gas. Private companies have
also continued to build more interconnectors to European neighbours.
There are now x interconnectors built, up from one pre-privatisation and
in 2024 the UK imported about x% of its power through these cables.
Despite both these trends, gas continues to drive the overall market and
prices, even if it only accounts for about one-third of the power
used.</p>
<p>Why does this matter for prices? Well gas is quite an expensive fuel.
It creates half the carbon of coal, and is much cleaner to burn, meaning
there is vastly less local air pollution. And power stations have to buy
carbon permits, which operate like a tax on natural gas that domestic
and many business users don‚Äôt have to pay when they burn gas in boilers
or cookers. These carbon permits add about x% (or ¬£x/tonne) to the cost
of the gas.</p>
<p><strong>Accounting tricks</strong> Starting in 2010, when the
coalition government got serious about the pace of expansion of
renewable generation, they needed to finance a substantial expansion of
Britain‚Äôs wind, solar and biomass generation at a time of public
expenditure restraint (austerity). The private companies developing
these projects needed subsidies through ROCs (and later CfDs). Unlike
longstanding government support such as agricultural subsidies, export
guarantees or student loans, which are treated as public expenditure and
inflate the size of the recorded deficit and national debt figures,
renewable energy subsidies were structured to avoid this accounting
treatment.</p>
<p>The key innovation was the Levy Control Framework (LCF), which
allowed the government to commit to long-term subsidy payments without
these liabilities appearing on the national balance sheet. ROCs and CfDs
are essentially contracts between the government and private companies,
but they‚Äôre financed through levies on consumer bills rather than direct
government spending. This means that while the government is legally
committed to paying these subsidies for 15-20 years (in the case of
CfDs), the total liability - which could run to tens of billions of
pounds - doesn‚Äôt count towards the official national debt figure.</p>
<p>This accounting treatment was crucial politically, as it allowed the
coalition to claim it was reducing the deficit while simultaneously
committing to massive long-term spending on renewable energy
infrastructure. It‚Äôs a classic example of ‚Äúoff-balance sheet‚Äù financing
- the economic reality is that British consumers are paying for these
subsidies through their electricity bills, but the government can claim
it‚Äôs not adding to the national debt.</p>
<p>Putting additional levies or charges onto energy bills to fund these
costs was preferable to tax rises for political reasons. Given the
levies are mandatory, they could be described as a stealth tax.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing the cost evenly</strong> Given the decision to
finance renewable subsidies off energy bills, the Government was then
faced with the decision of which energy bills to target. At the time,
only around 85% of households and a smaller 60% of businesses had a gas
supply, while nearly 100% of homes and businesses have an electricity
supply. The decision was taken to finance the bulk of subsidies and
supports for renewables from levies and charges to electricity bills. It
was felt that the burden of these charges would then be felt broadly in
proportion to how much electricity they used. By raising the levies off
a single fuel i.e.¬†electricity rather than a mix of different fuels, it
was felt that the administration would be simpler. As the levies would
not be traditional excise duties like road fuel (petrol and diesel) the
Government could also avoid presenting them as tax rises.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity levies discourage heatpumps</strong> When they
were first introduced, electricity levies weren‚Äôt that significant. In
2012, the cost of electricity for households was around 12-14p/kWh and
gas was around 5-6p/kWh, a ratio of roughly 2.5 to 1. However, over
time, the levies have grown dramatically. Analysis by Ben James on the
excellent <a href="https://www.electricitybills.uk">Electricity
bills</a> shows how such levies have increased far more than
expected:</p>
<h6 id="generation-subsidies-per-household">Generation Subsidies per
household:</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Renewables Obligation</strong>: More than doubled from
¬£39.85 in 2015-16 to ¬£108.18 in 2025 (FYTD)</li>
<li><strong>Contracts for Difference (CfD)</strong>: Exploded from just
¬£0.13 in 2015-16 to ¬£31.27 in 2025 (FYTD), though they briefly turned
negative during the 2022-23 energy crisis when wholesale prices were
high</li>
<li><strong>Capacity Market</strong>: Grew from ¬£0.07 to ¬£28.67 over the
same period</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="social-and-infrastructure-costs-per-household">Social and
Infrastructure Costs per household:</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>ECO (Energy Company Obligation)</strong>: More than doubled
from ¬£11.78 to ¬£27.09</li>
<li><strong>Smart Meter Charges</strong>: Nearly tripled from ¬£6.94 when
it started in 2018-19 to ¬£19.82 in 2025</li>
<li><strong>Warm Home Discount</strong>: Increased from ¬£6.56 to
¬£10.98</li>
</ul>
<p>The total burden of these levies per household has grown from around
¬£70 annually in 2015-16 to over ¬£200 today, representing a nearly
threefold increase in just a decade. About 30% of household electricity
bills are now levies and VAT. This dramatic growth explains why
electricity has become so expensive relative to gas, and why the current
price ratio is now closer to 4:1 rather than the ratio of 2.5:1 of
2012.</p>
<p>At this level, electricity bill levies are a significant detractor
from the effort to sell and install heatpumps (and in some cases EVs). A
well installed heatpump is about 350% efficient, and a well installed
gas boiler about 90% efficient. But a heatpump is typically 4 times more
expensive to purchase (¬£8,000-12,000) than a gas boiler
(¬£2,000-3,000).</p>
<p>If we didn‚Äôt have levies on electricity bills, but had instead funded
the costs through general taxation, and the cost of electricity were
still just 2.5 times more expensive than gas (currently 7p), then
heating homes with heatpumps would be around 35-40% cheaper, with a
typical saving (assuming annual heating/hotwater use of 12,000 kWh) of
¬£400-550/year, especially if homes ditched their gas connection and
avoided ¬£100-150 of standing charges.</p>
<p>Taking this argument further still, if we had instead put the cost of
levies onto gas bills rather than general taxation, then the cost of
electricity would be about 1.5 times more expensive than gas. At this
level, then heating homes with heatpumps would be around 65% cheaper
than gas, with a typical saving of ¬£600-750/year. For homes with solar
PV and/or a battery, then heatpump savings would be even greater,
perhaps ¬£1,000/year. With this sort of savings, many homeowners could
have achieved a clear payback in 5-10 years, and heatpumps would quickly
have been popular without Government support or major subsidies.</p>
<p>However, because the Government continued with imposing large levies
on electricity bills, it has been far more difficult to persuade
homeowners of the rationale to install heatpumps. This has meant:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Government is now paying an upfront grant of ¬£7,500 per property
(as well as a VAT exemption worth another ¬£2,000 on average). If
heatpump installations hit 800,000 a year in 2028 as the Government
hopes, these grants will cost ¬£6bn a year. This is a massive figure, for
context the total budget for all the primary schools in England is about
¬£6-7bn.</li>
<li>Because heatpump installations rely on grant funding that‚Äôs on an
unsustainable path, installers aren‚Äôt recruiting and training enough new
installers. They‚Äôre rightly nervous given how previous Governments have
cut support for Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) and other energy efficiency
grants like ECO.</li>
<li>Because of the lack of qualified installers, the Government is
having to subsidise the training, by offering grants and funding for
training programs, creating yet another taxpayer-funded intervention in
what should be a self-sustaining market.</li>
<li>Only affluent households are installing heatpumps. This means the
taxpayer is subsidising the better off to get expensive heating systems
they could afford anyway, while poorer households continue to struggle
with high electricity bills. Research shows that 70% of heat pump
installations are in homes in the top 40% of income brackets, with the
average household income of heat pump adopters being ¬£65,000 - well
above the UK median of ¬£32,000.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Taxing Gas</strong> The obvious solution or remedy to the
current mess is to move (or rebalance as it‚Äôs commonly referred to),
levies from electricity and onto competing fossil fuels. At the moment
there are very few taxes on natural gas, especially that used in
households. On the total retail price of 7p/kWh, levies account for just
0.5-1p/kWh, which is drastically less than electricity, especially as a
percentage.</p>
<p>Given most energy companies that supply electricity also supply gas,
it would be feasible to move many of the levies onto gas. But while this
could plug much of the gap, and many energy users using a mix of
electricity and gas might not notice much overall change in their bills,
there would still be winners and losers. Levies or taxes migt also need
to be extended to LPG, heating oil and coal fuels to avoid a perverse
incentive for energy users to shift from mains gas to one of these
alternatives, all of which have higher carbon emissions and local air
pollution. However doing so would probably require the Government
formally creating or increasing excise duties, which are taxes, and this
would draw more potentially unwelcome political attention.</p>
<p>The basic rebalancing proposal has been around for a decade, and
successive Governments have resisted the suggestion. At the core of its
reluctance is the perception that any move which increases the price of
natural gas would be considered regressive, and sharply increase the
cost of the most basic need for heating in the winter months.</p>
<p>Of course, rebalancing from electricity to gas has a positive effect
on both sides of the coin. It doesn‚Äôt therefore take that much to
significantly alter the economics of a home contemplating an investment
in a heatpump.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Electricity Levies on EVs</strong> It‚Äôs true that
electricity levies also have some impact on discouraging the adoption of
EVs. However, as explained in <a
href="./16-exercise-duty-road-pricing.md">Chapter 16</a>, petrol and
diesel duties remain very significant compared to the minimal levies and
taxes on natural gas. For homeowners with a driveway, there‚Äôs ample
incentive to charge at home, with overnight tariffs available as cheap
as 6.5p/kWh for charging. The bigger challenge is the cost of VAT on
public charging, which mainly affects those without driveways.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-11-price-cap---the-sticking-plaster-solution">Chapter
11: Price Cap - The Sticking Plaster Solution</h1>
<p>Retail electricity prices were fully liberalised in the year 1999. In
the period since privatisation in the year 1990, they had been regulated
because there wasn‚Äôt yet competition. From then until 2018, the market
was in charge. However, in the years after 2010, higher energy bills
became a more regular item on the political agenda. Eventually, the
Labour party, then under the leadership of Ed Miliband (previously and
once again energy secretary) pledged to introduce a price cap in the
2015 general election.</p>
<p>Though the Labour lost the 2015 election to the Conservatives, the
price cap was a popular proposal and high energy issues didn‚Äôt dissipate
as an issue. In the following 3 years, average energy bills didn‚Äôt rise
for engaged consumers that actively compared and switched suppliers.
However active residential customers were only about 40% of the market,
or 10 million out of about 25 million homes. For the remaining 15
million (or 60% of homes) who weren‚Äôt actively a tariff, prices were
significantly higher. There are a number of conclusions Government could
have made from this. Clearly, if you are hoping for retail competition
to be the main lever to keep energy prices competitive, if a majority of
households aren‚Äôt active in the market, something is inadequate or
missing. There were some efforts to boost the volume of switching,
though the advent of price comparison sites since year x had
dramatically cut the</p>
<p>Political concern therefore continued to grow. Eventually, in 2018 a
price cap was introduced. Customers remain free to chose a tariff from
different suppliers. However, if a customer at any point hasn‚Äôt actively
agreed a tariff, suppliers are obliged to enroll residential customers
onto a default, price-capped tariff.</p>
<p>The price cap levels are published quarterly by the regulator. The
methodology is <a
href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-regulation/domestic-and-non-domestic/energy-pricing-rules/energy-price-cap/energy-price-cap-default-tariff-levels">extensively
documented</a> and is recommended for anyone trying to understand the
composition of home energy bills. As of 2024-25, a typical home
electricity bill of ¬£869 breaks down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wholesale costs</strong> - ¬£311 (36%) - The cost
suppliers pay to buy electricity from generators on the wholesale
market. This is the most volatile component and drove the massive bill
increases during 2021-22. In reality in a free market, suppliers can
choose how far forward to hedge or buy the wholesale energy they need to
satisfy customer demand. However, for the purposes of the price cap the
potentially overly simplistic assumption that suppliers will hedge 12
months in advance is made.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network charges</strong> - ¬£209 (24%) - Covering the
poles, wires and infrastructure that deliver electricity to your home.
This includes transmission charges (TNUoS - ¬£40), system balancing costs
(BSUoS - ¬£32), and distribution network costs (DUoS - ¬£138).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy levies</strong> - ¬£226 (26%) - The biggest chunk
of hidden costs, funding renewable energy subsidies and social
programmes:</p>

<li>Renewables Obligation: ¬£104 (supporting older wind/solar
projects)</li>
<li>Contracts for Difference: ¬£34 (supporting newer renewables)</li>
<li>Feed-in Tariffs: ¬£23 (small-scale solar/wind payments)</li>
<li>Capacity Market: ¬£21 (keeping backup power plants available)</li>

</ul>
<p>Now because of the way the price-cap assumes forward hedging of about
12 months, when wholesale energy prices started rising very dramatically
in 2021-2, suppliers found themselves in a difficult situation. This
meant that suppliers were no longer able to offer competitive tariffs to
active customers looking to switch in the market. However, under the
price-cap regulation, suppliers continued to be required to offer a
price-cap tariff to all customers at rates that weren‚Äôt keeping pace
with the spike in wholesale costs. For the first time since competition,
it was no longer advantageous for householders to shop around for energy
tariffs, but instead accept the default, price-cap tariff from their
supplier. This advice was quickly diseminated by consumer groups,
influencers like Martin Lewis and the media. Suppliers started
withdrawing their fixed tariffs. Then around 30 suppliers went bust -
including Bulb Energy, which required a ¬£2.2 billion taxpayer bailout
before being sold to Octopus Energy.</p>
<p>Credit is due to regulatory and industry the handling of the 30
defunct suppliers. In each case, customers were allocated to a new
supplier with no interruption to their energy supply. However, the
retail energy market ended up with far fewer competitors; ironically the
price cap had inadvertently destroyed the very competition it was meant
to encourage.</p>
<p>Eventually, by September 2022, with wholesale energy prices
continuing to rise, the Government intervened much further in the energy
market and started directly subsidising home energy bills. This decision
was about the only lasting policy decision enacted by the short-lived
Truss administration. Given the economically liberal image projected by
Truss, the choice and extent of the subsidies proposed is somewhat
ironic. Initial estimates suggested costs of ¬£60-140 billion, but the
actual cost turned out to be around ¬£40 billion total - still roughly
¬£1,400 per household. This included ¬£21 billion for the Energy Price
Guarantee itself (keeping bills at ¬£2,500), ¬£12 billion for the
universal ¬£400 household rebate, and ¬£5.5 billion for business
support.</p>
<p>However, the energy price guarantee, as it was known, was not a cap
on the bills paid by households. Instead, it was a direct subsidy paid
by Government to energy suppliers - essentially the state picking up the
difference between wholesale costs and the ¬£2,500 household target. This
represented a complete abandonment of market pricing, with taxpayers
subsidising energy consumption regardless of usage levels or household
income. The irony was complete: a supposedly free-market Conservative
government had nationalised household energy costs in all but name.</p>
<p>Remarkably, this ¬£40 billion commitment was made without proper
parliamentary scrutiny or Treasury costings. The EPG was announced on 8
September 2022 - the day before the Queen‚Äôs death - which suspended
parliamentary business for ten days of national mourning. When
Parliament resumed, the mini-budget chaos dominated proceedings. The
Energy Prices Bill wasn‚Äôt even introduced until 12 October (over a month
after the policy began), received just a few hours of debate, and was
fast-tracked to Royal Assent within two weeks. No Office for Budget
Responsibility forecast was sought, no cost-benefit analysis was
conducted, and no proper parliamentary committee scrutiny occurred. The
largest peacetime fiscal intervention in British history was implemented
with less parliamentary oversight than a typical local planning
application.</p>
<p>To put the magnitude of the Energy Price Guarantee into context, ¬£40
billion is roughly equivalent to the entire annual education budget for
England, or about half the annual defence budget. During Covid, the
Government spent ¬£69 billion on furlough support over two years. The EPG
was a vast programme, handing a significant payment in kind to almost
every household in the country.</p>
<p>However, the scheme was deeply regressive. Although the ¬£400
household rebate was uniform, the Energy Price Guarantee itself was paid
per unit of energy consumed, meaning the largest subsidies went to those
with the biggest and worst insulated homes. While a typical household
might have received ¬£800-1,000 in EPG support, a wealthy family in a
large, poorly insulated country house could easily have received
¬£3,000-5,000 in taxpayer support. The owner of a 10-bedroom mansion with
an annual energy bill that would have been ¬£8,000 without the cap
received roughly ¬£5,500 in government subsidy - ten times more than a
pensioner in a well-insulated flat. The policy essentially socialised
the heating costs of the wealthy while providing minimal help to those
who needed it most at a time that widespread inflation hit every aspect
of household expenditure.</p>
<p>The scheme was also regressive across generations. To understand the
scale of this inequality: the wealthiest 10% of UK households
(predominantly older homeowners) hold 43% of all wealth, while the
bottom 50% (disproportionately younger people) hold just 9%. The richest
1% possess more wealth than the bottom 50% combined. Meanwhile, older
households received the biggest energy subsidies while paying minimal
tax to fund them (particularly pensioners), while younger people - more
likely to live in small flats or shared accommodation - received little
direct benefit but will spend decades paying higher taxes to service the
additional ¬£40 billion of national debt. In effect, young renters in
London bedsits subsidised the heating bills of older homeowners in large
detached houses, then got handed the bill to pay it back over the next
30 years.</p>
<p>More worryingly from the perspective of basic economics, the energy
price guarantee did nothing to solve the underlying problem causing the
energy price shock that Europe faced. Following a severe restriction on
the supply of gas from Russia, the logical policy response was to reduce
demand for gas to force down the market price. These could have
included:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Public information campaigns</strong> - informing the
general public of the shortage of natural gas, the reasons for it, and
the actions they could take, reducing heating and hotwater use, that
could lead to an improvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maximum legal temperatures for heating</strong> - France
imposed 19¬∞C limits in public buildings and encouraged the same in
private homes, while Germany set 19¬∞C for offices and 16¬∞C for corridors
and lobbies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced working hours</strong> - Moving to 3-4 day
working weeks to cut commercial energy demand, or encouraging remote
working to reduce both office heating and commuting. That said, remote
working in winter in the UK, where most homes are heated with gas could
feasibly have increased demand for gas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Temporary cohabitation incentives</strong> - Tax breaks
or payments encouraging families to move in with friends or relatives
during extreme cold snaps, reducing the number of homes needing
heating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public building closures</strong> - Closing non-essential
public buildings (libraries, community centres) during peak demand
periods and consolidating services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industrial demand management</strong> - Paying
energy-intensive industries to reduce production during peak hours,
rather than subsidising their consumption.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, the UK chose to subsidise consumption rather than reduce it
- the exact opposite of what basic economics would suggest during a
supply shortage.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the energy price shock was over more quickly than
initially expected. Wholesale gas prices began falling in early 2023 as
European storage filled up, alternative LNG suppliers were found, and a
mild winter reduced demand. By July 2023, the Government announced the
end of the Energy Price Guarantee, reverting to the normal Ofgem price
cap. The crisis that supposedly justified ¬£40 billion of taxpayer
spending had largely resolved itself through normal market mechanisms -
exactly what would have happened faster and cheaper if demand had been
reduced rather than subsidised.</p>
<p>The price cap, originally introduced as a temporary measure to
protect vulnerable customers from supplier exploitation, has instead
evolved into a permanent feature of the energy market. What began as a
‚Äústicking plaster‚Äù solution to a competition problem had become the
foundation for the largest peacetime fiscal intervention in British
history. Rather than fixing the underlying issues with Britain‚Äôs energy
system, the price cap had simply made them more expensive for taxpayers
to ignore.</p>
<p>More worryingly, the Energy Price Guarantee has created a dangerous
precedent. Having bailed out energy consumers once, the electorate now
expects the same treatment during any future price spike.
Psychologically, voters believe it is the Government‚Äôs responsibility to
ensure energy prices remain affordable, regardless of the cost to future
taxpayers. This creates classic moral hazard - when people expect to be
rescued from the consequences of their choices, they make riskier
decisions.</p>
<p>The bailout has reduced incentives for both households and businesses
to invest in energy resilience:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Household energy efficiency</strong> - Why spend ¬£10,000
on insulation, heat pumps, or solar panels when the Government will
subsidise your gas heating bills instead? The EPG removed the price
signal that would drive investment in home energy independence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industrial energy efficiency</strong> - Why should
factories invest in energy-saving equipment when they can expect
taxpayer support during price crises? Heavy industry now has less
incentive to reduce consumption or switch to alternative energy
sources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy market resilience</strong> - Why should suppliers
hedge their wholesale purchases properly when they know the Government
will intervene to prevent customer bankruptcies? The EPG has made the
entire energy supply chain more fragile by removing market
discipline.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Energy Price Guarantee essentially nationalized energy price risk
while keeping energy supply private - the worst of both worlds.
Consumers get the illusion of market choice while taxpayers bear the
cost of market failures. This moral hazard ensures that Britain will be
even less prepared for the next energy shock, making future bailouts
both more likely and more expensive.</p>

id="chapter-12-epcs---energy-performance-certificates-that-dont-work">Chapter
12: EPCs - Energy Performance Certificates That Don‚Äôt Work</h1>
<p>Energy Performance Certificates are supposed to inform users of the
energy costs and environmnetal impact of buildings. There are separate
certificates for residential homes and commercial premises. EPCs were
introduced in the year x, last x years and are required whenever a
building is offered for rent or sale.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, the EPC system as it exists at the moment
is dysfunctional.</p>
<h1 id="quality-of-assessment">Quality of Assessment</h1>
<p>The current EPC can be undertaken by assessors with minimal training
- typically just a few days of classroom instruction and some supervised
assessments. The going rate for an EPC assessment is about ¬£60-80,
reflecting the low barriers to entry and the commoditized nature of the
service. For most vendors and landlords, it is a tickbox exercise to
satisfy legal requirements rather than a genuine attempt to understand
or improve the property‚Äôs energy performance.</p>
<p>The assessment process itself is heavily reliant on standardized
assumptions rather than detailed analysis. Assessors typically spend
20-30 minutes in a property, taking basic measurements and checking for
obvious features like double glazing, cavity wall insulation, and boiler
types. Many factors that significantly affect energy performance - such
as air tightness, thermal bridging, or the quality of installation - are
either estimated from standard assumptions or completely ignored. It is
a fact almost universally accepted that EPCs overestimate the heat loss
of walls in most older houses, as the methodology assumes worst-case
scenarios for thermal performance rather than accounting for the actual
thermal mass and construction techniques used in traditional buildings.
The result is that two identical properties can receive different EPC
ratings depending on when they were assessed, who conducted the
assessment, or even which version of the assessment software was
used.</p>
<p>This variability undermines the credibility of EPCs as reliable
indicators of energy performance. Personal experience bears this out -
I‚Äôve seen significant inconsistencies between EPCs on the same house
over time, with insulation levels mysteriously falling between
assessments despite no physical changes being made to the property. Even
more concerning are the differences between houses clearly constructed
at the same time on the same estate, where identical properties can
receive different EPC ratings based purely on which assessor conducted
the evaluation. Homeowners and buyers cannot trust that an EPC rating
accurately reflects the actual energy efficiency of a property, making
it difficult to make informed decisions about energy improvements or
property purchases.</p>
<h1 id="outdated-emissions-methodology">Outdated Emissions
Methodology</h1>
<p>The current EPCs in use employ a methodology that was agreed in 2012.
Since then, Britain‚Äôs electricity system has undergone a dramatic
transformation. Coal generation has been phased out entirely, while wind
and solar now provide over 40% of our electricity. However, in the
methodology used by current Energy Performance Certificates, the share
of coal in electricity is still assumed to be around 30% and the
emissions from electricity are calculated as 450-500 g/CO2/kWh, which
implies the emissions from using a heat pump are almost as high (at
around 130-150 g/CO2/kWh) as a gas boiler (around 210 g/CO2/kWh).</p>
<p>Given the actual carbon intensity of electricity in 2024 is more like
115 g/CO2/kWh, the emissions of a heat pump operating at 350% efficiency
are now around 33 g/CO2/kWh, making them approximately 84% lower than a
gas boiler.</p>
<h1 id="missing-outputs">Missing Outputs</h1>
<p>The outputs shown on an Energy Performance Certificate focus around
the annual costs and energy usage. Although the calculation framework
considers each of the following, they are not presented to the end
user:</p>
<h3 id="variations-in-energy-prices">Variations in energy prices</h3>
<p>The cost to run a house in an energy performance certificate uses
standardized energy prices set by the EPC methodology, which are updated
periodically but not automatically with current market prices. Over the
last 5-10 years there have been dramatic swings in energy costs, with
electricity prices rising from around 14p/kWh in 2012 to 25p/kWh in
2024, and the 2022 energy crisis causing unprecedented volatility.
During the energy crisis, wholesale gas prices peaked at over ¬£400/MWh,
causing household energy bills to double within months. However, EPC
calculations continue to use the standardized prices from the
methodology, meaning the running costs shown on certificates become
increasingly disconnected from actual energy bills over time. This
creates a misleading picture for homeowners and potential buyers, as the
EPC running costs don‚Äôt reflect the real financial impact of the
property‚Äôs energy performance.</p>
<h3 id="heat-loss">Heat Loss</h3>
<p>The heat loss of a building is the amount of heat that it looses at a
given temperature. It can be expressed either as a number of watts per
degree that the outside air temperature falls below 16C or so
e.g.¬†100W/C, or alternatively a design heat loss e.g.¬†5KW, which is the
amount of heat needed to keep the house inside at a comfortable 21C when
the oustide temperature is at the minimum that can be reasonably
expected, depending where in the UK you are this is between -2C and 2C
or so.</p>
<p>Knowing the heatloss of building had some value, but ultimately
wasn‚Äôt that important in an age when most buildings were heated with
boilers. Most boilers are dramatically oversized for the heat loss of
the building, which allows them to rapidly heat them on demand, which in
turn allows the central heating to be turned on separately in the
morning and evening on a day when all occupants go out during the
daytime. To give you a feeling of typical oversizing, a typical gas
combi boiler might have an output of 25KW or so, even though the design
heat loss of a typical house might be 5-10KW.</p>
<p>However, for heatpumps, and in particular those thinking of
installing a heatpump, the design heat loss is incredibly important.
It‚Äôs the single figure that indicates ho large the heatpump you might
want to install in the house is. It‚Äôs a pre-requisite for rough
installation cost estimate.</p>

<h2
id="the-last-50-years---the-rise-and-rise-of-the-gas-combi-boiler">The
last 50 years - the rise and rise of the gas combi boiler</h2>
<p>For the last 50 years, Britain has benefitted from easy access to
natural gas. Nowadays 85-90% of homes are heated with natural gas, which
replaced a number of inferior solutions, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Coal derived gas</li>
<li>Coal fires and back boilers - which are more hazardous and created
vastly more localised pollution</li>
<li>Heating oil and storage heaters - which remains common in the most
rural areas, but has been squeezed out of most suburbs and larger
villages by the arrival of natural gas</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the same period, the number of homes and buildings with proper
central heating has grown from x% to x%. Whereas previously, homes might
have had a number of manually controlled fireplaces, and some rooms
e.g.¬†bedrooms and kitchen/bathrooms that went largely unheated. This has
significant health benefits, especially for the vulnerable and
elderly.</p>
<p>More recently, combi (combination) gas boilers have also enabled many
homes to ditch having a separate hot water tank. By burning a lot of gas
very quickly, much quicker than typically used for central heating, they
enable homes to heat enough hot water to run showers and baths
on-demand. Over the same period, homes have also abandoned loft tanks
for fresh water, the combination of which has freed up significant
storage space, which is of particular value in smaller properties and in
parts of the country like London and the South East which have seen the
most rapid growth in property prices.</p>
<p>The volume of gas boiler sales has also meant significant
improvements in their efficicency, which in well installed properties
can now push 90%.</p>
<h2 id="turning-tide-post-2000">Turning tide post 2000</h2>
<p>In the last 20-25 years, the previous infallible status of gas combi
boilers has started to wane somewhat.</p>
<p>First, Britain‚Äôs production of domestic North Sea gas peaked in the
year 2000, when it covered almost all our annual gas demand, and has
declined about 70% since then, meaning we now import about 50% of our
gas annually. In the peak winter heating season, this figure can reach
70-80% and the majority of our seasonal imports come from far-flung LNG
(Liquefied Natural Gas) markets like the US and Qatar. LNG gas is more
expensive because it has to be liquefied at high pressure and
transported across oceans in specifically designed tankers. Turning the
gas into a high-pressure liquid requires masses of energy, meaning LNG
is about 15-25% higher in carbon emissions than pipeline gas. This is
especially true for US shale-derived gas, where there are extra carbon
emissions associated with fracking the rock formations and processing
the gas before liquefaction.</p>
<p>And LNG is also much less secure than UK gas, or gas imported under
long-term pipeline contracts with our neighbour Norway, because LNG
cargoes go the highest global bidder, which can include rapidly growing
Asian markets, and are dependent on the political stability and goodwill
of producers like the US and Qatar.</p>
<p>Starting in 2003 and escalating to the full-scale 2022 Ukraine
invasion, Russia has become an increasingly less reliable and desirable
pipeline gas supplier to continental Europe, where it was previously so
dominant that countries like Germany had no LNG import facilities and
many others relied exclusively on Russian pipeline gas. Over this
period, Russia has threatened to cut off gas supplies at least 15 times,
including major disputes in 2006, 2009, 2014, and 2019 that disrupted
supplies to Eastern Europe and created political pressure on Western
European countries. This pattern of using energy as a political weapon
has put the UK competing with demand for both LNG cargoes and Norwegian
pipeline gas, even though the UK itself has never directly bought much
Russian gas.</p>
<h2 id="gdp-versus-short-term-cost-savings">GDP versus short-term cost
savings</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs worth going into a bit more discussion here about the difference
between trying to find the cheapest and most convenient way of heating
our homes and businesses and taking the long-term approach in terms of
what‚Äôs best for our economy, living standards and incomes.</p>
<p>In the short-term, for many of the last 20-25 years, importing
increasing volumes of gas from abroad has been cheaper and easier than
sourcing the same energy from alternative sources, like nuclear, wind or
domestic shale. However, each time we install or replace a gas boiler,
we commit ourselves for that boiler‚Äôs lifetime, typically 10-15 years,
to importing more foreign gas. And when we buy energy from abroad rather
than making it ourselves, that money creates very few jobs in our own
country, and raises very little in tax revenues for our Government.
Instead it helps other countries.</p>
<p>The balance of trade is rather neglected as a concept. Put simply, it
shows the net surplus or deficit in how much the country as a whole
spends. If you look at oil and gas over the last 25 years, then as a
percentage of our overall income (or GDP), the cost of energy imports
has risen dramatically, from being around ¬£75 per person in 2000 when
North Sea production was at its peak, to reaching ¬£1,200-1,500 per
person during the 2022 energy crisis. Even now, with prices having
moderated, energy imports still represent about ¬£600-900 per person
annually - a significant drain on our economy that was partly
avoidable.</p>
<p>Had we invested more in domestic energy sources like nuclear, wind
and shale gas, then we might have paid more upfront for the energy,
particularly the investment required. However, much of that investment
would have stayed within the UK economy, we would have better
infrastructure and assets, and during energy price shocks like 2022, our
economy would have been more insulated. This is true even if domestic
energy producers had been allowed to increase their prices, provided we
had sensible profit (including if needed, windfall) taxes in place to
collect and redistribute.</p>

<h1
id="chapter-14-cfd-vs-marginal-pricing---market-design-disasters">Chapter
14: CfD vs Marginal Pricing - Market Design Disasters</h1>
<p>There is a urban myth that all British electricity is expensive
because of the role of gas fired power.</p>
<p><strong>PPAs</strong> Most commonly associated with renewable
projects like wind and solar, a PPA contract is a bilateral, over the
counter agreement that bypasses the wholesale electricity market an
enables generators to sell their power at a longer term more fixed rate
to an energy supplier or an industrial customer that uses lots of
electricity. This agreement can be mutually beneficial because it can
allow the energy consumer to fix their prices (potentially indexed by
inflation) and for the generator to insulate themselves from any
flucations in wholesale prices. This is particularly important for
obtaining debt finance at reasonable rates, because without this sort of
guarantee, the profits of renewable power generators can be incredbly
voltaile.</p>
<p><strong>CfDs</strong> The Government CfD programme is designed to
stabilise the cost of renewable electricity relative to the more
volatile wholesale gas price. The way is does this is to effectively
sell an insurance policy to the developers of renewable projects that
tops-up, or knocks-off any difference between the wholesale price and a
guaranteed strike price that they will end up receiving. The money to
pay any top-ups, when the wholesale price is low come from a CfD levy on
consumers, and any surplus in times of high prices goes back to
consumers as a credit. This means that both from the perspective of the
renewable generator and the end consumer, there is essentially a fixed
price for the power that is generated under CfDs. So while the wholesale
power market continues to exist, and operates as a market of last resort
to enable fine tuning of the electricity grid, there is much greater
stability at an outer level. By the year 2030, over x% of Britain‚Äôs
power is expected to be generated under CfDs. The more power which is
generated under CfD‚Äôs the more stable power prices will become. The
wholesale power price will remain important to generators and the grid
for balancing the grid, but it will be increasingly irrelevant when it
comes to determining consumer prices.</p>

15: Flexibility, Balancing and Storage - The Grid‚Äôs Hidden
Challenges</h1>
<h2 id="why-timing-matters-the-9-5-problem">Why Timing Matters: The 9-5
Problem</h2>
<p>If you ask a typical well-informed Brit when the electricity grid
feels the most strain, chances are they‚Äôll respond with the old story
about balancing the spike in kettle use that happens during must-watch
TV events and especially knock-out Euros and World Cup England football
matches. While it‚Äôs a memorable story that explains the need for hydro
pumped storage (and these days, batteries) on the grid quite poignantly,
it‚Äôs never really been true.</p>
<p>The reality is rather less charming. Much of the electricity spike
comes from fridge compressors in pubs and homes as spectators grab cold
drinks during the match. And yes, there‚Äôs also a surge from water
companies as everyone rushes to the toilet during half-time, forcing
pumping stations to work overtime to refill cisterns. Neither of these
explanations has quite the same romantic appeal as the tea-making story,
so it‚Äôs no wonder the kettle myth persists - it‚Äôs much more British.</p>
<p>The bigger explanation as to why this isn‚Äôt true however is that
major England football matches, which in the age of Netflix are about
the last remaining collective live TV event, represent the wrong kind of
stress on the grid. These events create short-term demand spikes lasting
perhaps 15-30 minutes - the kind that can be managed with quick-response
storage like pumped hydro or batteries. The grid is never under much
strain at 8-9pm on a summer evening, when the World Cup or Euros matches
are typically held.</p>
<p>Instead, the real challenge comes from sustained high demand that
stretches the entire generation system for hours on end. This happens
between 4pm and 7pm on winter weekday evenings and during school term
times - a completely different type of stress that requires the grid to
operate near its maximum capacity for extended periods. There are a
number of complementary reasons for this sustained high demand:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It gets dark from 3pm onwards, especially in mid winter, further
north and on overcast days. This drives a need for lighting both in
buildings and on streets that doesn‚Äôt exist to the same degree in the
rest of the year. And while the development of LED lighting has
dramatically cut the use of electricity in this space, lighting remains
a significant contributor to UK electricity demand during winter
months.</p></li>
<li><p>It‚Äôs colder in winter, which created greater demands for
heating.</p></li>
<li><p>Families begin the preparation of evening meals, especially those
with younger children. Cooking appliances use lots of electricity,
especially ovens!</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the school working day at 3-4pm and office working day
at 5pm creates a particular spike in home heating demand as thermostats
warm-up homes in preparation for people arriving home.</p></li>
<li><p>The mismatch of the end of the school working day (3-4pm) and
office working day (5pm) creates an overlap period from 4 to 5:30pm when
most offices are still open and using electricity for computers,
lighting or machinery, but many households and especially those with
children are at home and using appliances there e.g.¬†for cooking. This
coincidence, the use of electricity in both sets of locations at once,
albeit only for a relatively short period of time, is what drives the
need for a lot of the investment in our energy system and the costs we
see on our bills.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="two-types-of-grid-stress">Two Types of Grid Stress</h2>
<p>Understanding this distinction is crucial for energy policy. There
are fundamentally two different types of stress on the electricity
grid:</p>
<p><strong>Short-term spikes</strong> (like football matches) last 15-30
minutes and can be managed with: - Quick-response storage (batteries,
pumped hydro) - Demand-side response (asking consumers to reduce usage
briefly) - Fast-start gas plants</p>
<p><strong>Sustained peak demand</strong> (winter evenings) lasts 2-3
hours and requires: - Significant generation capacity to be available
and running - Multiple backup systems to be on standby - The entire grid
infrastructure to operate near maximum capacity</p>
<p>The winter peak is far more challenging because it requires sustained
operation of the entire generation fleet at high levels, not just
quick-response backup systems. This is why the grid needs so much
investment in generation capacity, transmission lines, and distribution
networks - not because of occasional TV events, but because of the
predictable, sustained demand patterns of modern life.</p>
<p>There are laudable attempts by suppliers to discourage use of
electricity in peak periods. Smart tariffs reward customers for this and
this is possible because the suppliers can avoid more expensive
wholesale energy prices in the peak hours, when the least efficient
power stations and batteries are needed to meet demand, as well as
punitive charges from the electricity networks. Over time, automation
and remote control of home batteries, heat pumps and EVs is likely to
extend this sort of demand response much further and without any
conscious behaviour from end users. Indeed, given the spike in
electricity demand over the 4-7pm period is often only 5-8 GW, it would
only take around 2-3 million homes installing a standard 3kW battery to
completely eliminate this peak. That said, as we use more power and
especially power from renewables, the goal posts may shift higher
further into the future.</p>
<p>It begs the question of whether a more root-and-branch review of how
we structure our working day might be called for. The norms we have -
such as the 9-5 working day for adults and 13 weeks of school holidays
per year - are a legacy of Victorian industrial practices, for example
when children were needed to gather summer harvest crops. Recent
evidence has called into question the productivity of knowledge-focused
work in particular, with research suggesting that an 8-hour working day
may not be optimal for cognitive tasks. Closing offices earlier would
significantly reduce electricity demand during peak periods, allow
working parents to more easily collect children from school, and bring
substantive improvements to mental health and road safety (fewer
journeys completed in the dark).</p>
<p>Another aspect of why our current working day adds so much to energy
bills is that we only really put significant pressure on the energy
system for a relatively short period of time. So the fixed cost of
maintaining an energy system capable of meeting these peak demands is
spread over a relatively limited number of hours and days. The main
winter season lasts from early November (just after the clocks go back)
to late February. During this period, there is much less pressure on the
grid on weekend evenings (which account for 2 out of 7 days). There is
also significantly less pressure on Friday evenings, as people are more
likely to head out straight from the office, eat later, or dine out.
This pattern is further interrupted by the Christmas fortnight and, to
some extent, the February half-term week, which also sometimes falls in
a different week around the country. And from the start of March, even
if the weather isn‚Äôt much warmer, the lighter evenings are enough to cut
the use of much lighting. Putting all this together, there are only
really around 70 potential evenings - Monday to Thursdays between
November and February. And if the weather is particularly mild and
windy, which with climate change it often is, this can further reduce
the strain on the grid as heating demand is lower and there is abundant
wind generation on the grid. In many winters, we might realistically
only face 20 evenings when we put much strain on the grid.</p>
<p>However, adopting a model where we require dynamic behaviour change
in response to strains on the grid has risks. It is likely to be
inherently disruptive, like the overnight routine changes faced by many
families during COVID. The alternative - blackouts - are vastly more
disruptive, so it would always be worth even very drastic action to
avoid this eventuality. But even with automated solutions like smart
batteries and EVs, there‚Äôs still a strong case for a more joined-up
approach that considers broader social, education, and health policy.
The 9-5 working day and school hours that create our peak energy demand
aren‚Äôt just energy policy issues - they affect family life, mental
health, road safety, and educational outcomes. A coordinated approach
that addresses these multiple benefits could be more effective than
relying solely on technological fixes. Moreover, making an overall and
permanent change - such as shifting typical working hours earlier -
would be more predictable for both the energy system and for families,
rather than requiring constant adaptation to grid conditions.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-challenge-grid-flexibility">The Technical
Challenge: Grid Flexibility</h2>
<p>Britain‚Äôs electricity grid faces a fundamental challenge that has
grown dramatically in recent years: the need for flexibility to balance
supply and demand in real-time. As we‚Äôve increased our reliance on
intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar, the traditional
model of matching generation to demand has become increasingly complex
and expensive. We‚Äôre also moving more of our heating from fossil fuels
to electricity (mostly heatpumps), meaning in winter especially, our
demand for electricity might start to grow dramatically (to date it
hasn‚Äôt).</p>
<h2 id="the-balancing-challenge">The Balancing Challenge</h2>
<p>Unlike fossil fuels, electricity cannot be stored easilly, at not
without other technologies and investment in big hydro dams and
batteries. Grids are inflexible, supply and demand must be balanced
second-by-second. The grid can only tolerate energy imbalances of about
1% - roughly 400-500MW in Britain‚Äôs system - before automatic
load-shedding kicks in to prevent cascading blackouts. When this
balancing fails, the consequences can be severe: Iberia‚Äôs grid collapse
in April 2025, triggered by a combination of unexpected demand spikes
and insufficient backup generation, left millions without power and
demonstrated how quickly a modern electricity system can fail when the
balance between supply and demand breaks down.</p>
<p>This balancing act has become significantly more challenging as our
energy mix has shifted from predictable fossil fuel plants to variable
renewable sources.</p>
<h3 id="the-scale-of-the-problem">The Scale of the Problem</h3>
<p>In 2024, wind and solar now provide over 40% of Britain‚Äôs
electricity, up from less than 10% in 2010. This transformation has
created new challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wind variability</strong>: Wind output can vary from
near-zero to full capacity within hours</li>
<li><strong>Solar intermittency</strong>: Solar generation drops to zero
every evening and is reduced on cloudy days (and winter!)</li>
<li><strong>Demand patterns</strong>: Peak demand still occurs on winter
evenings when renewable generation is typically low</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a system that requires far more sophisticated balancing
mechanisms than the simple ‚Äúturn up the gas‚Äù approach that worked when
fossil fuels dominated.</p>
<h2 id="current-balancing-mechanisms">Current Balancing Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Britain‚Äôs electricity system uses several mechanisms to maintain
balance:</p>
<h3 id="the-balancing-mechanism">1. The Balancing Mechanism</h3>
<p>National Grid ESO operates the Balancing Mechanism, where generators
and demand-side response providers can offer to increase or decrease
output to help balance the system. This operates in real-time, with
offers typically made 1-4 hours ahead.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-response-services">2. Frequency Response Services</h3>
<p>These services respond automatically to frequency changes on the
grid: - <strong>Primary Response</strong>: Automatic response within 10
seconds - <strong>Secondary Response</strong>: Automatic response within
30 seconds<br />
- <strong>High Frequency Response</strong>: For when generation exceeds
demand</p>
<h3 id="reserve-services">3. Reserve Services</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term Operating Reserve (STOR)</strong>: Gas and diesel
plants that can start within 20 minutes. In the recent past, there have
also been special reserve contracts for coal plants approaching
retirement, though these have now all lapsed.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Containment</strong>: Fast-acting batteries and
other technologies responding within 1 second</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-flexibility">The Cost of Flexibility</h2>
<p>The increasing need for flexibility has created a significant new
cost category in the electricity system. In 2023, balancing costs
reached over ¬£2 billion annually, up from around ¬£200 million a decade
ago. These costs are passed through to consumers via network
charges.</p>
<h3 id="why-costs-are-rising">Why Costs Are Rising</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reduced inertia</strong>: Traditional thermal plants
provide system inertia naturally. As these close, we need to pay for
synthetic inertia from batteries and other technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More volatile prices</strong>: With intermittent
renewables, electricity prices can swing from negative (when wind is
high and demand low) to over ¬£1,000/MWh (when demand is high and wind is
low).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backup capacity</strong>: We still need enough
dispatchable capacity to meet demand when renewables aren‚Äôt available,
but this capacity earns less revenue when renewables are
generating.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="storage-technologies">Storage Technologies</h2>
<h3 id="battery-storage">Battery Storage</h3>
<p>Battery storage has emerged as a key technology for providing
flexibility, though adoption varies significantly across markets. The
cost of battery storage has fallen dramatically, from over ¬£1,000/kWh in
2010 to under ¬£200/kWh in 2024, making it increasingly competitive with
traditional energy storage. With a lifetime of 6,000-8,000 cycles, and a
finance (cost of capital) cost of 7.5%, a battery charging and
discharging every day (called cycling) can typically achieve a payback
if it can charge at 8-12 pence/kWh less than it can discharge, over a
lifetime of 16-22 years. This calculation accounts for 10-15% of the
energy to be lost during the charging and discharging process (called a
round-trip efficiency of around 85-90%) - the rest is lost as heat. This
8-12 pence/kWh spread (¬£80-120/MWh) is roughly the same as the cost of
generating power for a few hours every evening from a medium efficiency
gas power plant.</p>
<h2 id="battery-storage-deployment-britain-vs.-europe-vs.-us">Battery
Storage Deployment: Britain vs.¬†Europe vs.¬†US</h2>
<h3 id="united-states-the-battery-leader">United States: The Battery
Leader</h3>
<p>The US leads global battery storage deployment, particularly in
California and Texas. California‚Äôs aggressive renewable targets and high
electricity prices have created strong economics for battery storage,
with over 6 GW installed by 2024. Texas has become the second-largest
market, driven by its deregulated electricity market and extreme weather
events that create high price volatility. The US benefits from federal
tax credits and state-level incentives, making battery projects highly
attractive to investors.</p>
<h3 id="europe-catching-up">Europe: Catching Up</h3>
<p>European battery deployment has been slower, constrained by
regulatory barriers and fragmented markets. Germany leads European
deployment, driven by high electricity prices and strong renewable
integration needs. Britain has been catching up rapidly, with over 2 GW
of battery storage deployed by 2024, supported by capacity market
mechanisms and frequency response services. However, European projects
face higher costs due to more complex permitting and grid connection
processes compared to the US.</p>
<h3 id="britain-unique-challenges-and-opportunities">Britain: Unique
Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
<p>Britain‚Äôs battery market has unique characteristics. The country‚Äôs
high electricity prices and significant renewable capacity create strong
arbitrage opportunities, but high interest rates and complex grid
connection processes have slowed deployment compared to the US.
Britain‚Äôs capacity market provides revenue certainty, but the lack of
long-duration storage incentives has focused investment on
shorter-duration applications. With continued cost reductions and market
reforms, Britain could see accelerated battery deployment, particularly
for grid-scale applications.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-battery-storage">Types of Battery Storage</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Grid-scale batteries</strong>: Large installations
installed by utilities and connected directly to the power grid. These
installations are increasingly common, particularly alongside
conventional power generators (like wind and solar farms), to share the
existing grid connection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Behind-the-meter storage</strong>: Household and
commercial batteries can be installed where power is already being
consumed. When combined with onsite solar PV, such storage allows a site
to extend the self-sufficiency potential of the PV by charging during
the daytime and using the electricity stored in the evening and
nighttime, a process which typically makes significant additional bill
savings through significant grid levy savings on electricity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Electric vehicles</strong>: Mobile storage that can
in-theory provide vehicle-to-grid services. To date, this is still a
technology in its infancy and the mass adoption of it isn‚Äôt expected for
some years yet due to regulatory and technical issues. Almost all
existing car chargers (and most cars) are not able to do this, so we‚Äôre
some way off it having an impact.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-case-for-low-hanging-fruit">The Case for Low-Hanging
Fruit</h2>
<p>Rather than pursuing the most ambitious battery storage projects,
there‚Äôs a strong argument for focusing on the low-hanging fruit -
investments that offer lower risk and more stable returns. These include
behind-the-meter storage combined with solar PV, where the economics are
more predictable and the returns more certain. A household with solar
panels and a battery can avoid grid charges and time-of-use pricing,
creating a guaranteed return that doesn‚Äôt depend on volatile wholesale
electricity markets. Similarly, commercial and industrial sites can use
batteries to reduce peak demand charges, which are often the largest
component of their electricity bills. These applications provide steady,
predictable returns that are less exposed to market volatility than
grid-scale storage projects that rely entirely on wholesale price
arbitrage. By focusing on these lower-risk applications first, the
industry can build experience, reduce costs, and create a foundation for
more ambitious grid-scale projects as technology matures and markets
develop.</p>
<h3 id="pumped-hydro-storage">Pumped Hydro Storage</h3>
<p>Britain has four major pumped hydro facilities in Snowdonia (Wales)
and Scotland. These each hold enough energy when fully loaded (charged)
to run at full tilt for 5-7 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dinorwig (1,728 MW -&gt; 5.3 hours, 9.1 GWh)</li>
<li>Ffestiniog (360 MW -&gt; 5.6 hours, 2.0 GWh)<br />
</li>
<li>Cruachan (440 MW -&gt; 7.3 hours, 3.2 GWh)</li>
<li>Foyers (300 MW -&gt; 6.7 hours, 2.0 GWh)</li>
</ul>
<p>A major new pumped storage project, Coire Glas near Loch Ness, has
been approved and could add 1,500 MW with 30 GWh of storage
capacity,with nearly nearly double the energy storage of all existing
British facilities combined it should hopefully be able to run for 20
hours at full capacity. Coire Glas could rival some of Europe‚Äôs largest
pumped storage schemes like Grand Maison in the French Alps.</p>

<h1
id="chapter-16-exercise-duty-road-pricing---transport-energy-policy">Chapter
16: Exercise Duty &amp; Road Pricing - Transport Energy Policy</h1>
<h2 id="a-personal-introduction">A Personal Introduction</h2>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt a typical student, even by Cambridge standards. Back in
2009, I co-founded a non-partisan student think-tank called the <a
href="https://www.thewilberforcesociety.co.uk">Wilberforce Society</a>
with a Wordpress blog on which I‚Äôd penned a controversial article
advocating road pricing. When the Government of the day floated ideas in
this area, my article was found by a number of journalists who
approached me for comment. They were somewhat disappointed to hear I was
a mere undergrad. As an economics student, road pricing made intrinsic
sense to me and continues to do so. However, to most people it‚Äôs deeply
controversial.</p>
<h2 id="the-economics-of-fuel-duty">The Economics of Fuel Duty</h2>
<p>Petrol and diesel duties are about 58p per litre, or roughly 40% of
the total price when you throw in 20% VAT. For the Government, this
makes them an incredibly important tax, raising over ¬£25 billion
annually, or about 3% of total tax revenues. Indeed, they raise more
than corporation tax on small businesses, inheritance tax, and capital
gains tax combined - making fuel duty one of the government‚Äôs most
reliable and substantial revenue streams.</p>
<p>What makes fuel duties particularly attractive to the Treasury is how
easy they are to collect. Unlike income tax or VAT which require
millions of individual transactions and returns, fuel duties are
collected from just a handful of major oil companies and import
terminals. The tax is levied at the wholesale level before it reaches
consumers, meaning collection doesn‚Äôt directly involve individual voters
or require complex enforcement. This makes it both politically
convenient and administratively efficient - a perfect cash cow for any
government.</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, fuel duty also has some merit as a proxy
for road usage and environmental impact. All things considered, the tax
per litre is not a bad approximation for the number of miles vehicles
travel, the size of the vehicle, and the level of its emissions. Larger,
heavier vehicles consume more fuel per mile, so they pay more tax. More
fuel-efficient vehicles pay less. And the more you drive, the more fuel
you buy and the more tax you pay. While not perfect - it doesn‚Äôt account
for congestion, road wear, or the specific location of journeys - it‚Äôs a
reasonable first-order approximation that has served Britain‚Äôs transport
policy for decades.</p>
<h2 id="the-limitations-of-fuel-duty">The Limitations of Fuel Duty</h2>
<p>The main social problem (externality in technical speak) that
petrol/diesel tax doesn‚Äôt address well are the more urban problems of
congestion and localised air pollution. A diesel car or delivery truck
driving around the countryside poses no risk to those with lung problems
and asthma - the same car idling outside a suburban school gate does.
Fuel duty treats all fuel consumption equally regardless of where it
happens, but the social costs vary dramatically by location and timing.
This creates a fundamental mismatch between the tax and the actual harm
caused.</p>
<p>This shortcoming is why cities like London, Manchester and others
have sought to introduce extra charges - especially on higher emitting
vehicles. The London Congestion Charge, Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ),
and similar schemes in other cities are attempts to address the specific
urban externalities that fuel duty cannot capture. These local charges
target the vehicles that cause the most harm in the most sensitive
locations, creating a more targeted approach to managing urban transport
problems.</p>
<p>While the efforts of these cities are laudable, the lack of a
coordinated national approach creates the risk of a race to the bottom
where dirtier vehicles are recycled or relocated to more provincial
towns and cities. As London and other major cities implement stricter
emissions standards, older, higher-emitting vehicles don‚Äôt simply
disappear - they often end up being sold to buyers in smaller towns or
rural areas where such restrictions don‚Äôt exist. This can create a
perverse outcome where urban air quality improves at the expense of air
quality in areas that may have fewer resources to address the health
impacts of poor air quality.</p>
<h2 id="what-fuel-duty-actually-costs-per-mile">What Fuel Duty Actually
Costs Per Mile</h2>
<p>To put fuel duty in perspective, let‚Äôs work out what it actually
costs per mile to drive. A typical VW Golf with a 1.5-litre petrol
engine might achieve around 35 miles per gallon (mpg) in real-world
driving conditions. With fuel duty at 58p per litre and 4.55 litres per
gallon, that works out to about ¬£2.64 in fuel duty per gallon. At 35
mpg, this means fuel duty costs approximately 7.5p per mile driven. This
gives us a baseline understanding of what drivers currently pay for road
usage through fuel duty - a figure that will become increasingly
important as we consider alternatives.</p>
<p>For a typical driver covering around 8,000 miles per year, this works
out to about ¬£600 annually in fuel duty. When you add VAT at 20% on the
total fuel cost, the total tax burden rises to around ¬£720 per year.
This is a significant sum that drivers have become accustomed to paying,
and it represents the revenue that any alternative road pricing system
would need to replace if fuel duty were to be abolished or significantly
reduced.</p>
<p>This contrasts sharply with Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), which is a
flat annual tax based on vehicle emissions rather than usage. For a
typical petrol car, VED might be around ¬£180 per year - just 25% of what
the same driver pays in fuel duty. This highlights the fundamental
difference between the two taxes: VED is a fixed cost that doesn‚Äôt vary
with how much you drive, while fuel duty is a variable cost that
directly reflects road usage. It‚Äôs this usage-based nature that makes
fuel duty such an effective proxy for road usage, but also makes it
vulnerable to changes in driving patterns and vehicle technology.</p>
<p>To put this 7.5p per mile fuel duty in context, it‚Äôs worth comparing
it to other motoring costs. The total cost of motoring (including fuel,
insurance, maintenance, depreciation, and other running costs) typically
ranges from 30p to 60p per mile depending on the vehicle. So fuel duty
represents about 12-25% of the total cost of driving. However, many of
these 30-60p costs are invisible or annualised from the perspective of
the end user - depreciation happens gradually, insurance is paid
annually, and there‚Äôs an opportunity cost of having cash tied up in a
vehicle rather than invested elsewhere or paying down debts or a
mortgage off early. By comparison, a typical bus journey costs around
15-25p per mile, while rail travel varies dramatically from 10p per mile
for long-distance advance tickets to over 50p per mile for peak-time
commuter journeys. This shows that fuel duty, while significant, is just
one component of transport costs, and any replacement system needs to
consider the broader financial impact on households.</p>
<h2 id="the-electric-vehicle-challenge">The Electric Vehicle
Challenge</h2>
<p>This being said, petrol and diesel taxes face significant headwinds.
Politically, fuel taxes haven‚Äôt kept up with inflation since 2010,
following intense lobbying and campaigning, under Governments of all
parties. And while the total mileage driven has stayed quite steady
since 2010 (though there have been shifts from cars and commuting toward
delivery vans, especially since COVID and the rise of remote working),
the biggest challenge going forward is the growth of electric vehicles.
These now account for about 3% of the total vehicle fleet, and 2% of
total mileage. But they account for 16% of new vehicle sales, and the
Government‚Äôs own target is for this to reach 100% by the year 2035.</p>
<p>The tax implications of this transition are stark. A typical electric
vehicle might use around 0.3 kWh of electricity per mile driven. At a
rapid charging station costing 80p per kWh, this works out to 24p per
mile - of which the government collects 4p in VAT (20%). At home on an
overnight tariff of 7p per kWh, the same journey costs just 2.1p per
mile, with VAT of only 0.11p (5%). Compare this to the 7.5p per mile
fuel duty that petrol drivers pay, and you can see the problem: even at
expensive public charging, EV drivers are paying less than half the tax
per mile, while home charging reduces their tax contribution to less
than 2% of what petrol drivers pay. This creates a fundamental inequity
that will only grow as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.</p>
<p>This VAT disparity creates a particularly perverse social outcome.
Better-off households with driveways can charge their EVs at home on the
5% VAT rate, while less well-off drivers and renters who can‚Äôt persuade
their landlords to install chargers are forced to use expensive rapid
charging stations at 20% VAT. The result is that wealthier EV owners pay
both lower prices and lower tax rates, while poorer EV owners face
higher costs and higher tax rates. This is exactly the kind of
regressive policy outcome that the energy transition was supposed to
avoid, and it highlights why simply relying on electricity taxation to
fund roads creates both revenue problems and social equity issues.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-electricity-levies-for-road-funding">The
Problem with Electricity Levies for Road Funding</h2>
<p>The broader problem with trying to fund roads through electricity
levies is that electricity bills already carry significant policy costs
- including the Renewables Obligation, Contracts for Difference, and
Capacity Market charges that support the energy transition. While these
could arguably be considered taxes, they serve specific policy purposes.
Trying to raise additional revenue for roads by increasing electricity
levies would create perverse incentives that work against other
government objectives. Higher electricity prices would disincentivise
the adoption of electric heating and heat pumps, which are crucial for
decarbonising buildings. They would also make electric vehicles less
attractive relative to petrol cars, undermining the very transition
that‚Äôs creating the need for alternative road funding in the first
place. This illustrates why road funding needs to be separated from
energy policy - the two objectives can conflict with each other.</p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="./10-electricity-levies.md">Chapter 10</a>
in this book, there are arguably already too many charges on electricity
bills compared to natural gas. Electricity carries the burden of funding
renewable energy, grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency schemes,
while gas - which remains the dominant heating fuel and a major source
of carbon emissions - faces relatively few policy levies. Adding road
funding to electricity bills in a bid to replace lost petrol and diesel
taxes would only exacerbate this imbalance, making electricity even more
expensive relative to gas and further disincentivising the switch from
gas boilers to heat pumps. This creates a perverse situation where the
cleaner energy source (electricity) becomes more expensive than the
dirtier one (gas), working directly against decarbonisation goals.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-road-pricing">The Case for Road Pricing</h2>
<p>Road pricing, by contrast, is the logical solution that addresses all
these problems. Modern vehicles - both electric and petrol - almost
universally come equipped with GPS and inbuilt SIM cards, making
distance-based charging technically straightforward. With just a handful
of major car manufacturers, collecting tax revenues from them could
almost be as straightforward as collecting petrol and diesel taxes is
from today‚Äôs oil and gas producers. Integration with insurance companies
could create additional benefits, as insurers could offer discounts for
safer driving patterns and lower mileage, potentially offsetting some of
the road pricing costs for responsible drivers. Perhaps most politically
appealing is the opportunity to charge foreign-registered vehicles that
use British roads. With around 2 billion miles driven annually by
foreign vehicles on British roads, road pricing at 7p per mile could
raise around ¬£140 million annually from drivers who currently contribute
nothing to road maintenance. Indeed, there‚Äôs a strong case for charging
foreign drivers more than British drivers - after all, they don‚Äôt pay UK
income tax, council tax, or other contributions to public services, so
asking them to pay a premium for road usage could be seen as fair. A
higher rate for foreign vehicles, perhaps 10-15p per mile, could
significantly increase this revenue stream while remaining politically
popular. While this is a useful additional revenue stream, it‚Äôs clear
that the main funding would need to come from British drivers - the
foreign vehicle revenue is just the cherry on top of a system that
treats all road users equally regardless of their vehicle type or
charging options.</p>
<h2 id="the-time-is-now">The Time is Now</h2>
<p>For various reasons, the stars are now aligning for road pricing in a
way they weren‚Äôt back in 2009 when I wrote that controversial blog post.
The technical barriers have largely disappeared with the ubiquity of GPS
and connected vehicles. The fiscal imperative has become urgent as
electric vehicles erode fuel duty revenue. And the political landscape
has shifted, with growing recognition that the current system creates
inequities between different types of drivers and different charging
options. What once seemed like an economist‚Äôs pipe dream is now becoming
a practical necessity.</p>

<h1
id="chapter-17-brexit-friction---how-leaving-the-eu-made-energy-harder">Chapter
17: Brexit Friction - How Leaving the EU Made Energy Harder</h1>
<h2 id="the-gb-model-and-european-integration">The GB Model and European
Integration</h2>
<p>When I started working in energy markets, a common term in use was
the GB model. This was the informal term given to the way that the EU
had adopted the British privatisation model as a template for
frictionless trade across European markets. At the core of the single
market for energy was the notion of harmonised regulations, standardised
trading mechanisms, and seamless cross-border electricity and gas flows
that treated the entire continent as one integrated market.</p>
<p>This trajectory only gained momentum as the growth in renewables took
hold in different European markets. Wind and solar are intermittent, and
enabling previously siloed national electricity markets to trade the
inevitable surpluses and shortages which happen over time is of clear
mutual benefit. This was perhaps most obvious for Britain (and Ireland),
which account for around 40% of Europe‚Äôs wind resources, but which are
separated by sea from the continent. However, prior to 2011, Britain‚Äôs
international electricity connections were limited to just two cables:
the 1986 IFA cable linking England with France, and the 2001 Moyle
interconnector linking Northern Ireland with Scotland.</p>
<p>Being within the EU single market for electricity meant that Britain
could trade power with Europe almost as easily as trading within the
country itself. From 2014, Britain joined a clever system called
‚Äúimplicit day-ahead coupling‚Äù - essentially a computer algorithm that
would automatically work out the best way to buy and sell electricity
across multiple countries at once, moving power to wherever it was
needed most and could fetch the best price. There was no need for energy
companies to separately bid for space on the cables - it all happened
seamlessly behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The day-ahead market is by far the most important electricity trading
venue - it‚Äôs where the bulk of power is bought and sold for delivery the
following day, and it‚Äôs the most ‚Äúliquid‚Äù market (meaning there are lots
of buyers and sellers, making it easy to trade large volumes without
moving prices dramatically). This was becoming increasingly crucial for
Britain as wind power expanded, because wind generation is unpredictable
and varies significantly from day to day. Having access to Europe‚Äôs
deep, liquid day-ahead markets meant British wind farms could easily
sell their surplus power when the wind was blowing hard, and Britain
could readily import power when the wind dropped.</p>
<p>Building cables across the seabed is significantly more expensive
than over land, typically costing 3-5 times more per kilometre. Despite
this cost premium, the economic benefits of cross-border electricity
trading have been substantial, allowing Britain to export surplus wind
power to Europe during periods of high generation and import nuclear and
hydro power from France and Norway during periods of low wind.</p>
<h2 id="britains-interconnector-expansion">Britain‚Äôs Interconnector
Expansion</h2>
<p>Following BritNed in 2011, Britain embarked on a major expansion of
its interconnector network. To the continent, the Nemo cable to Belgium
came online in 2019, ElecLink through the Channel Tunnel to France in
2021, IFA2 cable to France in 2021, and the North Sea Link to Norway in
2021. Britain also expanded its connections with Ireland: the Moyle
interconnector linking Northern Ireland to Scotland had been operational
since 2001, followed by the East-West interconnector connecting Ireland
to Wales in 2012, and the Greenlink interconnector from Ireland to Wales
which began operations in 2025. Several more interconnectors are planned
or under construction including additional links to Denmark, Germany,
and further Ireland-Britain connections.</p>
<p>While these interconnectors were mutually beneficial to both Britain
and the continent, they were typically more valuable to Britain than to
its European neighbours. Continental countries already had extensive
networks of relatively cheap overland interconnectors linking them
together - France could trade with Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Spain, and Switzerland through land-based cables. Britain, as an island
nation, was far more isolated and dependent on these expensive subsea
links for access to European markets.</p>
<p>Recognizing this asymmetry, Britain‚Äôs energy regulator Ofgem had to
design a special subsidy mechanism called the ‚Äúcap and floor‚Äù regime to
guarantee interconnector developers a minimum revenue stream. This was
essential to make the expensive subsea projects financially viable.
Crucially, these subsidies were predicated on the assumption that the
interconnectors would have frictionless, automatic access to European
electricity markets through the implicit day-ahead coupling mechanism -
particularly important given Britain‚Äôs rapidly expanding but
intermittent wind generation that needed reliable export opportunities
when production was high.</p>
<h2 id="the-brexit-shock">The Brexit Shock</h2>
<p>Brexit threw this into doubt. Having access to the frictionless
‚Äúimplicit day-ahead coupling‚Äù required the UK to be subject to EU energy
market regulations and the jurisdiction of European institutions. When
Britain left the EU on 31 December 2020, it automatically lost access to
this seamless trading mechanism.</p>
<p>From 1 January 2021, Britain‚Äôs interconnectors reverted to the old
system of ‚Äúexplicit‚Äù capacity auctions - energy companies now had to
separately bid for space on the cables before they could trade
electricity. This added complexity, cost, and uncertainty to
cross-border trading. Instead of a single, automated process that
optimized flows across multiple countries simultaneously, British
traders now faced a two-step process: first win capacity in an auction,
then trade electricity in separate national markets that no longer
cleared together.</p>
<p>The impact was immediate and significant. Trading became more
expensive and less efficient. The sophisticated algorithms that had
automatically balanced supply and demand across borders were replaced by
a more cumbersome system that required separate decisions about capacity
allocation and energy trading. For Britain‚Äôs wind farms, this meant
losing the seamless access to European markets that had been crucial for
managing the intermittency of renewable generation.</p>
<p>This was precisely the kind of friction that the cap and floor
subsidies had never been designed to handle - the entire regulatory
framework had assumed continued participation in EU market mechanisms
that Brexit had now made impossible.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that this outcome wasn‚Äôt inevitable. During the
Brexit negotiations, there were options for a ‚Äúsofter Brexit‚Äù that could
have maintained Britain‚Äôs participation in EU energy market regulations
while leaving other areas of EU law and regulation. Countries like
Norway participate in parts of the EU‚Äôs internal energy market without
full EU membership. However, the UK government chose a harder Brexit
approach that prioritized regulatory sovereignty across all sectors over
maintaining sectoral integration in areas like energy where the benefits
of continued cooperation were particularly clear. This political choice
meant that billions of pounds of interconnector infrastructure,
subsidized by British consumers through the cap and floor regime, would
now operate under less efficient trading arrangements than originally
envisaged.</p>
<h2 id="the-financial-fallout">The Financial Fallout</h2>
<p>Despite the complexities introduced by Brexit, the volume of
electricity traded between Great Britain and continental Europe has
continued to grow significantly. In 2020, electricity imports via
interconnectors were approximately 22,391 GWh, supplying about 6.6% of
the UK‚Äôs gross electricity supply. By 2023, this figure had increased to
33,212 GWh, with interconnectors supplying around 10.4% of the UK‚Äôs
electricity.</p>
<p>The UK‚Äôs interconnector capacity has expanded significantly, reaching
8.4 GW by January 2023. This growth is driven by increased
interconnector capacity and the integration of renewable energy,
particularly wind power. Much of this growth can be attributed to
interconnector projects that were planned or agreed upon before the
Brexit vote in 2016 and the hard Brexit agreement in 2020. These
projects were part of long-term strategies to enhance energy security
and integrate renewable energy sources, particularly wind power, into
the UK‚Äôs energy mix. As a result, the physical infrastructure and
capacity expansions continued to progress despite the political and
regulatory uncertainties introduced by Brexit.</p>
<p>However, the financial implications for British taxpayers were
significant. The cap and floor regime guarantees interconnector
developers a minimum revenue - the ‚Äúfloor‚Äù - if their trading revenues
fall below a certain threshold. By making cross-border electricity
trading more expensive and cumbersome, Brexit would likely reduce both
the frequency and efficiency of trading on these cables. Less frequent
trading means lower revenues for interconnector owners, increasing the
probability that their earnings would fall below the guaranteed floor
levels. When this happens, British consumers are contractually obligated
to top up the difference through higher energy bills. The irony was
stark: Brexit had reduced the commercial value of infrastructure that
British taxpayers were legally bound to subsidize, potentially making
those subsidies more expensive precisely because the infrastructure had
become less useful to the British energy system.</p>
<p>These financial burdens are in addition to the higher electricity
costs and loss of export revenues that have resulted from the increased
friction in trade. The combined effect is a lose-lose situation for the
UK energy sector: higher costs for consumers and taxpayers, reduced
competitiveness for British energy exports, and diminished returns on
significant infrastructure investments. This underscores the complex and
far-reaching economic consequences of Brexit on Britain‚Äôs energy
landscape.</p>
<p>In recent times, there have been renewed hopes for better
harmonization between Britain and the EU in the energy sector. As the
realities of Brexit‚Äôs impact on energy trade become clearer, there is
growing recognition of the mutual benefits that closer regulatory
alignment could bring. Discussions have emerged around the possibility
of Britain moving closer to the EU‚Äôs regulatory orbit, particularly in
areas like energy market integration and renewable energy cooperation.
Such alignment could help reduce trade friction, enhance energy
security, and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. While
political challenges remain, the potential economic and environmental
benefits provide a compelling case for exploring pathways to closer
cooperation.</p>
<p>There is also a very compelling case for developing a shared offshore
grid in the North Sea, connecting the UK with other countries that have
major offshore wind installations. Such a grid could optimize the
distribution of renewable energy across borders, balancing supply and
demand more effectively and reducing the need for backup fossil fuel
generation. By pooling resources and infrastructure, participating
countries could achieve greater energy security, lower costs, and
accelerate the transition to a low-carbon energy system. The North Sea‚Äôs
vast wind resources present a unique opportunity for regional
cooperation, and a shared grid could serve as a model for future
collaborative energy projects.</p>
<h2 id="carbon-market-divergence">Carbon Market Divergence</h2>
<p>Another significant development was the decoupling of the UK from the
EU carbon market. Prior to Brexit, the UK was part of the EU Emissions
Trading System (EU ETS), which is a cornerstone of the EU‚Äôs policy to
combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The EU ETS
works on the ‚Äòcap and trade‚Äô principle, setting a cap on the total
amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by installations
covered by the system. After Brexit, the UK established its own UK
Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) in 2021, which is similar in design
but operates independently from the EU ETS.</p>
<p>This decoupling has implications for both markets. For the UK, it
means having the flexibility to set its own carbon pricing and emissions
targets, potentially allowing for more ambitious climate policies.
However, it also means losing the benefits of a larger, more liquid
market that can provide more stable carbon pricing and greater
opportunities for trading. For the EU, the loss of the UK as a
participant in the EU ETS reduces the overall size and liquidity of the
market, which could impact the effectiveness of the system in driving
down emissions across Europe. The decoupling highlights the broader
theme of Brexit: the trade-off between regulatory independence and the
benefits of integrated markets.</p>
<p>While the UK ETS provides flexibility, it also poses significant
risks. One major concern is the potential for a carbon border adjustment
mechanism (CBAM) to be imposed by the EU on UK goods. If the UK
maintains lower carbon prices than the EU, it could lead to competitive
imbalances, where UK industries benefit from lower costs at the expense
of higher emissions. To prevent carbon leakage and ensure a level
playing field, the EU has proposed a CBAM that would impose tariffs on
imports from countries with less stringent carbon pricing. This could
affect a wide range of UK exports, increasing costs for British
businesses and potentially leading to trade disputes. The risk of a CBAM
underscores the challenges of maintaining regulatory independence while
ensuring compatibility with major trading partners.</p>
<p>Since Brexit, the UK‚Äôs carbon prices have consistently been lower
than those in the EU. In 2023, UK carbon prices were approximately 28%
lower than those in the EU, with the UK price at ¬£35 per tonne of CO‚ÇÇ
equivalent. By 2025, UK carbon prices were around ¬£45 per tonne,
compared to the EU‚Äôs ‚Ç¨73 (approximately ¬£62) per tonne.</p>
<p>This disparity has significant economic implications. The lower
carbon prices have led to revenue shortfalls, with the UK raising over
¬£1 billion less over a six-month period in 2023 compared to 2022 levels.
If this trend continues, the Treasury could lose up to ¬£3 billion
annually. Additionally, the EU‚Äôs Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
(CBAM), set to be fully implemented in 2026, could impose up to ¬£800
million in additional costs on UK exporters by 2030.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, there have been discussions about
linking the UK ETS with the EU ETS. Such a linkage could harmonize
carbon prices, prevent competitive distortions, and reduce costs for
both UK and EU consumers. In May 2025, the UK and EU agreed to work
towards linking their respective Emissions Trading Systems.</p>
<p>For British exporters, facing a CBAM on exports to the EU in addition
to higher energy costs than many EU countries would be an extra trade
barrier they would prefer to avoid. The combination of these factors
could make UK goods less competitive in European markets, potentially
leading to reduced market share and profitability for British
businesses. This highlights the importance of addressing carbon pricing
disparities and energy cost challenges to maintain the competitiveness
of UK exports in the EU.</p>
<h2 id="carbon-price-impacts-on-electricity-costs">Carbon Price Impacts
on Electricity Costs</h2>
<p>Carbon prices play a crucial role in determining the cost of
gas-fired electricity generation. In both Britain and
Belgium/Netherlands/Ireland, gas power stations can be identical in
almost every respect‚Äîsimilar efficiencies, fuel costs, and
technologies‚Äîexcept for the carbon price. This single difference can
have a profound impact on the competitiveness of electricity generation.
A lower carbon price in the UK can make its gas-fired electricity
cheaper to produce, giving it a competitive edge in the market.
Conversely, a higher carbon price in the EU can make electricity from
similar stations more expensive, affecting where power is generated and
traded. This highlights the critical role of carbon pricing in shaping
energy markets and influencing cross-border electricity flows.</p>
<p>An artificially low carbon price in the UK can lead to unintended
consequences. By making gas-fired electricity generation cheaper in the
UK, it can shift emissions from gas power stations to Britain, as power
generation becomes more economically attractive domestically. However,
when this electricity is exported to the continent, it incurs higher
transmission losses, reducing overall efficiency. This not only
undermines the environmental benefits of lower carbon pricing but also
highlights the complexity of balancing economic and environmental
objectives in cross-border energy trade. It can also drive up the cost
of electricity relative to gas withint the UK, which hinders the
incentive for decarbonisation.</p>
<h2 id="solutions-and-pathways-forward">Solutions and Pathways
Forward</h2>
<p>To address the challenges outlined in this chapter, closer
harmonization with the EU on carbon prices and electricity trading
presents a clear and viable solution. Even without a comprehensive
re-entry into the EU single market, aligning the UK‚Äôs carbon pricing
with the EU ETS could mitigate the risk of a Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism (CBAM) and enhance the competitiveness of UK exports.
Harmonizing carbon prices would also help stabilize the market, reduce
revenue shortfalls, and prevent competitive imbalances.</p>
<p>In terms of electricity trading, re-establishing closer ties with the
EU‚Äôs energy market mechanisms could reduce trade friction, improve
efficiency, and lower costs for consumers. This could involve
negotiating agreements that allow for more seamless cross-border
electricity flows and participation in EU market coupling initiatives.
Such steps would not only enhance energy security but also support the
transition to a low-carbon economy by facilitating the integration of
renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these solutions highlight the importance of strategic
cooperation and alignment with the EU to address the economic and
environmental challenges posed by Brexit. By pursuing closer
harmonization, the UK can leverage the benefits of integrated markets
while maintaining its regulatory independence.</p>
<p>Recent developments have shown positive signs in this direction,
suggesting that there is room for optimism. Both the UK and the EU have
expressed interest in exploring pathways for closer cooperation on
energy issues. Discussions about linking the UK ETS with the EU ETS and
re-establishing energy market connections indicate a willingness to find
common ground. These positive noises suggest that, despite the
challenges of the past few years, there is potential for a more
collaborative and integrated approach to energy policy moving forward.
By building on these positive developments, the UK and the EU can work
together to address shared challenges and seize opportunities for mutual
benefit.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-18-interest-rates">Chapter 18: Interest Rates</h1>
<p>I learnt early in my career that the single most important figure in
short term electricity markets is the gas price. In long-term
electricity markets, the equivalent metric is the interest rate.</p>
<p>Starting my career in 2011 and despite having studied economics I
have to admit that I didn‚Äôt realise until really quite recently quite
how profound the effect of near zero interest rates was over the 2010
decade. And while many people have learnt the hard way how its
unravelling the rise in interest rates post 2021 has changed the world
of property, business and vehicle finance, It couldn‚Äôt have happened at
a more prescient and disruptive time for the Energy transition.</p>
<p>in Economics you learn that the interest rate is the connection or
the price between now and the future. High interest rates mean that
investors require a greater return on the capital in order to be better
off than simply putting the money in a bank account or low risk
investment like government bonds. All things equal, higher interest
rates make it more attractive to put off any sort of capital or upfront
investment like insulating a building, replacing a vehicle, installing a
battery.</p>
<h2 id="fossil-versus-low-carbon">Fossil versus Low Carbon</h2>
<p>the biggest Divide between fossil fuels and the appliances we used
them in and low carbon technologies brackets including renewables is the
amount of extra upfront investment You need if you want to pursue the
low carbon option. This paradigm holds true in all different levels and
sectors of the energy system:</p>
<p>###Gas Power versus Nuclear/Wind The upfront cost of a
state-of-the-art CCGT gas power station is around ¬£800-¬£1,200 per
kilowatt. The equivalent figure for a nuclear plant like Hinkley Point
is ¬£6,000-¬£8,000 per kilowatt. For an offshore wind farm it‚Äôs around
¬£3,000-¬£4,000 per kilowatt. However, when it comes to the running costs
or marginal costs of these technologies, the pattern reverses. Wind
farms don‚Äôt require fuel. Nuclear fuel is usually under ¬£10 per megawatt
hour of power generated. Gas power even at today‚Äôs relatively low prices
costs upwards of ¬£60-¬£80 per megawatt hour, given CCGTs are at best 55%
efficient and power stations face carbon taxes as well.</p>
<p>###Energy Networks Separate from the cost of generating electricity,
There are profound differences in the cost of the network and
infrastructure needed to support a renewables Oriented grid. Wind and
Solar are less dense in terms of their footprint on the ground than
traditional large scale power stations. They they also tend to be much
further from natural centres of demand in big cities, Partly because
Land prices are higher around cities and partly because the windiest
places tend to be quite remote isolated and either high up offshore or
coastal. An access factor in the UK is the role of NIMBYs in deterring
many renewable projects from less isolated parts of England.</p>
<p>Either way, renewables end up needing more miles of electricity
cables, pylons and substations to run the grid than would be needed from
traditional fossil fuels. And the cost of building this infrastructure
is very capital intensive. According to analysis from the Energy Bills
website, the contribution of energy network costs in household energy
bills has increased from around 20% in 2015 to 25% in 2025, making it
one of the biggest drivers in energy bill increases. This represents a
significant shift from operational costs (fuel) to capital costs
(infrastructure).</p>
<h3 id="gas-boiler-versus-heat-pump">Gas Boiler versus Heat Pump</h3>
<p>The gas boiler is cheap to manufacture and easy to install,
particularly for replacement jobs. For a typical home, a replacement gas
boiler might cost ¬£2,500 and in a typical year might result in a gas
bill of ¬£1,250. Retrofitting a heat pump might cost upwards of ¬£12,000
without government grants and might result in annual electricity costs
of ¬£750, or potentially lower if the house also has a battery and/or
solar PV installed.</p>
<h3 id="ice-versus-evs">ICE versus EVs</h3>
<p>The most expensive component in an EV is the battery, costing upwards
of ¬£8,000-¬£12,000 toward the typical cost of a family-sized car. In a
traditional petrol car, the equivalent is a simple fuel tank which costs
around ¬£200-¬£400 and holds 10 times as much energy. The cost of driving
a mile in a typical petrol car - let‚Äôs say a 1.5 litre VW Golf achieving
45mpg with petrol at ¬£1.50 per litre - is around 15 pence per mile. For
an identical size EV, the cost of driving that mile on cheap overnight
electricity taken from the grid (at around 8p/kWh) would be more like 2
pence per mile.</p>
<h2 id="compounding---the-effect-on-gearing">Compounding - the effect on
gearing</h2>
<p>The effect of higher interest rates has another knock-on effect
through the impact it has on the balance sheet of utilities and other
investments in the energy sector. Debt is cheaper than equity, or
shareholder money, and borrowing money from a bank enables energy
investments to be done at a lower cost. However, the banks or other
lenders that provide such finance have limits in terms of how much they
think it is safe and reasonable to lend. And when interest rates are
higher, the cost of servicing debts is also higher, meaning that a
project cannot sensibly borrow as much without running the risk of
running out of money and not being able to reliably service debts. This
creates a knock-on effect where projects have to stump up more
shareholder or equity money, which being more expensive further drives
up the cost of capital on investments in the energy sector and results
in higher costs to consumers or less investment taking place. You can
see this dynamic playing out very clearly in the annual CFD auctions for
offshore wind, which have increased from ¬£73 per MWh in 2022 to around
¬£103 per MWh in 2024.</p>
<h2
id="compounding---when-the-cause-is-supply-side-inflation">Compounding -
when the cause is supply side inflation</h2>
<p>Inflation can have different causes. In 2022, the shock was largely
one that started in energy and commodities. At the same time, the
hangover effects of Covid furlough schemes meant a simultaneous shock
took place in labour markets. For renewable projects that are capital
intensive and require large amounts of both specialist labour and
materials that require lots of energy such as steel and concrete, there
was a perfect storm for cost inflation.</p>
<p>This meant that renewable projects have had to deal with cost
increases from two simultaneous drivers: the cost of engineering and the
cost of financing that engineering over the lifetime of the project.</p>
<h2 id="its-the-real-interest-rate-that-actually-matters">It‚Äôs the real
interest rate that actually matters</h2>
<p>One common misunderstanding with interest rates is to ignore the
impact of inflation. If interest rates are 6% (called nominal rates),
but inflation is running at 5%, then in real-terms, interest rates are
only 1%. Viewed this this lens, real interest rates across the 2010-21
period were not just low, but for much of the period negative,
particularly following the monetary and quantitiative interventions
followint the financial crash, eurozone crisis, Brexit vote and
pandemic.</p>
<p>This perspective shines a different perspective on the consequential
2021-2 period, when the reopening post-pandemic hit a massive
inflationary shock. In the UK, interest rates set by the Bank of England
didn‚Äôt peak until August 2023 at 5.25%, by which point inflation was
6.7%. Even if 5.25% sounded like a high interest rate in nominal terms
by the standards of the last few decades, it was actually -1.45% in real
terms.</p>
<p>Since 2022, inflation has gradually slowed from its peak of over 11%
in 2022, but remained stubbornly above the traditional 2% target,
averaging around 4-5% through 2023-24. Despite this slowdown, the Bank
of England has been extremely cautious about cutting interest rates,
with only modest cuts by early 2025, leaving rates at 5.25%. This means
that real interest rates have been positive and significant (around
1-2%) for over two years now - a dramatic shift from the negative real
rates that prevailed for most of the previous decade.</p>
<p>This is particularly damaging for infrastructure investments like
offshore wind and nuclear, because the upfront construction costs are
financed at nominal interest rates, while the long-term returns are
inflation-indexed. When real rates are high, this mismatch squeezes the
economics of big capital projects, making them much harder to finance
and build.</p>
<h2 id="the-becalming-of-offshore-wind">The becalming of Offshore
Wind</h2>
<p>The current state of the offshore wind industry provides a helpful
metaphor for the effects of the last few years. The prolonged period of
ultra-low interest rates and rising climate change concerns led to
unparalleled investment in offshore wind between 2010 and 2020. There
were massive improvements in the supply chain and efficiency of building
offshore turbines. The size of turbines increased from around 3 MW to
over 15 MW, which increased yields and reduced the number of foundations
required.</p>
<p>Even going into the initial energy crisis of 2022, offshore wind
maintained momentum. The spike in fossil fuel prices left offshore wind
looking incredibly attractive, and some of the cost rises had not fully
worked their way through the system yet. Interest rates had not yet
peaked in real terms because inflation was high, but the market hadn‚Äôt
realised quite how long interest rates would need to stay at elevated
levels in a bid to control the persistent inflation that had crept into
the system.</p>
<p>New offshore wind farms bid for long-term, fixed-price contracts to
sell their electricity before they start construction; the fixed price
they receive is inflation-indexed and guaranteed by bill-payers under
the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme. Arguably, the high watermark
for optimism in offshore wind was the CfD AR4 auction in July 2022, when
7 offshore wind farms totalling 7 GW agreed to an equivalent long-term
price of ¬£52/MWh (¬£37.35/MWh in 2012 prices). This price was
astonishingly low; at the time, wholesale gas prices were around
¬£200/MWh. There was a widespread optimism that the early investment in
offshore wind had paid off, and that Britain was on the verge of a new
era of cheap, clean energy.</p>
<p>Since 2022, things have gone into dramatic reverse. A number of
offshore wind farms under development have been abandoned, including
several that had qualified and won long-term CfD contracts. Getting to
this stage is a massive investment in itself, costing ¬£50-100 million
and involving a team of 50-100 people including engineers, lawyers,
environmental consultants, and project managers over 5-8 years of
development work. In 2023, the CfD AR5 auction failed to attract any
winning bids from new offshore wind farms - the first time this had ever
happened, despite offering a maximum price of ¬£44/MWh in 2012 prices
(equivalent to around ¬£62/MWh in 2023 prices, up 19% from the AR4
auction). In 2024, under the new Labour Government, the maximum price
offered to offshore wind farms was hiked by another 40% from 2023
(¬£103/MWh in 2024 prices), and 3 wind farms won contracts. However, one
of them, the 1.5 GW Hornsea 3 project, then pulled out only 8 months
later, citing cost concerns despite the significantly higher price on
offer. Another CfD auction (AR7) is expected in September 2025, however,
major developers including √òrsted have indicated they may not
participate unless prices increase further, highlighting the ongoing
challenges facing the sector. √òrsted‚Äôs own troubles - including a rights
issue to raise ‚Ç¨4 billion, political controversy over its US projects,
and a share price that has fallen from over ‚Ç¨1000 in 2021 to under ‚Ç¨200
in 2024 - illustrate the broader financial pressures affecting the
offshore wind industry.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-low-hanging-insulation-fruit">The Case for
Low-Hanging Insulation Fruit</h2>
<p>In this environment of higher interest rates, there‚Äôs a compelling
argument for focusing on the low-hanging fruit - energy investments that
offer lower risk and more stable returns. Rather than pursuing ambitious
capital-intensive projects like new offshore wind farms or nuclear
plants, policymakers and investors should prioritise technologies and
measures that deliver quicker paybacks with less financial risk.</p>
<p>Insulation and energy efficiency improvements represent the most
obvious example. While retrofitting homes with proper insulation
requires upfront investment, the payback periods are relatively short
and the returns are often attractive even in a high interest rate
environment. While insulation savings do depend on energy prices (higher
prices mean faster paybacks), the relationship is straightforward and
predictable - unlike renewable energy projects that depend on volatile
electricity markets and complex wholesale pricing mechanisms, energy
efficiency measures deliver direct, proportional savings on energy
bills. Importantly, insulation is fuel-agnostic: whether a home is
currently heated by gas, oil, electricity, or will transition to heat
pumps or other renewable technologies in the future, the insulation
investment continues to deliver savings. This makes insulation a
particularly attractive investment in an uncertain energy transition
landscape.</p>
<p>The appeal of insulation goes beyond just financial returns - it‚Äôs
also remarkably simple to understand and explain. Any intelligent
homeowner can grasp the basic logic: less heat escaping in winter means
less energy needed to maintain comfort, which translates directly into
lower energy bills. The variables are straightforward: upfront cost,
annual energy savings, and simple arithmetic to calculate payback
period. Compare this to the complexity of renewable energy investments,
which depend on wholesale electricity markets, grid connection costs,
policy support mechanisms, and technological risk. Insulation offers the
rare combination of good economics and intuitive appeal.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more importantly, insulation creates a virtuous cycle
that unlocks cheaper heat pump installations. A well-insulated home
requires a smaller capacity heat pump, which costs significantly less
upfront. For example, a poorly insulated Victorian terrace might need a
10kW heat pump costing ¬£10,000-¬£12,000, while the same house after
insulation might only need a 7kW unit costing ¬£7,000-¬£9,000. The savings
are enhanced because smaller heat pumps can operate at lower flow
temperatures (45-50¬∞C rather than 55-65¬∞C), which improves their
efficiency. Heat pump efficiency (Coefficient of Performance or COP)
typically improves from around 2.8-3.2 at high temperatures to 3.5-4.0
at lower temperatures - meaning 15-25% less electricity consumption for
the same heating output. This cascading benefit means insulation doesn‚Äôt
just reduce energy demand, it makes the remaining demand cheaper to meet
with clean technologies.</p>
<p>Even if a homeowner can‚Äôt afford a heat pump immediately, or faces
planning restrictions or space constraints, insulation investment makes
the property ‚Äúheat pump ready‚Äù for the future. When the time comes to
replace the gas boiler, the smaller heat pump requirement, existing
radiator compatibility (or smaller radiator upgrades needed), and lower
flow temperature requirements make the transition much more
straightforward and affordable. This future-proofing aspect adds
significant value to insulation investments, particularly in an era
where heat pump adoption is accelerating but installation costs remain a
barrier for many households.</p>
<h3 id="insulation-measures-costs-and-paybacks">Insulation Measures:
Costs and Paybacks</h3>
<p>Based on Energy Saving Trust data and industry analysis, here‚Äôs how
the main insulation measures compare (assuming gas prices of around
6-8p/kWh, typical of 2024 UK energy costs). The scale of opportunity is
substantial - with around 28 million homes in the UK, millions could
still benefit from these improvements:</p>
<p><strong>Cavity Wall Insulation:</strong> - <strong>Cost</strong>:
¬£500-¬£1,500 for blown mineral wool or polystyrene beads (most common
retrofit method) - <strong>Annual Savings</strong>: ¬£150-¬£300 -

14-33% annually (excellent return) - <strong>Best For</strong>: Homes
built after 1930 with unfilled cavities - <strong>Potential
Scale</strong>: ~8-10 million homes still have unfilled cavities -
<strong>Retrofit Method</strong>: Small holes drilled in mortar joints,
insulation blown in using compressed air, holes patched - typically 1-2
day installation with minimal disruption - <strong>Note</strong>: Blown
mineral wool is the most popular retrofit approach due to its
cost-effectiveness, complete cavity fill, and fire resistance</p>
<p><strong>Solid Wall Insulation (External):</strong> -
<strong>Cost</strong>: ¬£8,000-¬£15,000 for a typical semi-detached house
- <strong>Annual Savings</strong>: ¬£400-¬£600 - <strong>Payback

<h1 id="chapter-19-shale-gas---a-missed-opportunity">Chapter 19: Shale
Gas - A Missed Opportunity</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h2>
<p>Shale gas is one of those energy topics that gets people really
worked up. As someone who cares deeply about climate change, I
understand why - the idea of more fossil fuels makes environmentalists
nervous. But when shale gas was being debated in Britain, I heard a lot
of misleading arguments on both sides. Some claimed it would solve all
our energy problems and make gas dirt cheap. Others insisted it would
poison our water and cause earthquakes. The reality, as so often happens
with energy policy, was somewhere in between.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs particularly frustrating about Britain‚Äôs shale gas story is
that it never really got a fair hearing. The debate was so polarised
that reasonable discussion became impossible. And in the end, we threw
away a potential source of domestic energy that could have made us more
secure and wealthier, without really understanding what we were giving
up.</p>
<h2 id="why-shale-gas-mattered">Why shale gas mattered</h2>
<p>Britain has been importing more and more gas over the years. We used
to produce most of what we needed from the North Sea, but that‚Äôs been
declining since around 2000. These days, about half our gas comes from
abroad - mostly from Norway via pipeline, but also from the US and Qatar
as liquefied natural gas (LNG).</p>
<p>When you buy energy from abroad, you‚Äôre not just spending money -
you‚Äôre also missing out on all the economic benefits that would come
from producing it at home. Every pound spent on imported gas is a pound
that doesn‚Äôt create British jobs, doesn‚Äôt generate British tax revenue,
and doesn‚Äôt build British infrastructure.</p>
<p>Had we developed our shale gas resources, we would have created jobs
in the regions where the gas was found. These aren‚Äôt just drilling jobs
either - there‚Äôs a whole supply chain of engineers, truck drivers,
equipment manufacturers, and service companies that would have
benefited. The salaries in oil and gas are typically ¬£65,000-75,000 a
year, roughly double the national average. That means each worker pays
significantly more in taxes than the average British worker.</p>
<p>The tax benefits are even more dramatic. Oil and gas companies pay
some of the highest taxes in the economy - around 65-75% of their
profits go to the Treasury, compared to 25% for most businesses. For
every pound spent on gas produced in Britain, about 21-27p goes back to
the government in taxes. For imported LNG, it‚Äôs more like 5p (just the
VAT). With our energy imports running at ¬£25-35 billion a year, that‚Äôs a
lot of potential tax revenue we‚Äôre missing out on.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-price-myth">The great price myth</h2>
<p>One of the most common arguments for shale gas was that it would make
gas much cheaper. ‚ÄúLook at America!‚Äù people would say. ‚ÄúGas is dirt
cheap there now!‚Äù But this argument missed some crucial differences
between Britain and the US.</p>
<p>The US shale boom happened because America had massive reserves of
shale gas that were globally significant. When the US started producing
shale gas in huge quantities, it changed the global gas market. Britain,
by contrast, has much smaller shale gas reserves. Even if we‚Äôd produced
every drop of our technically recoverable shale gas, it wouldn‚Äôt have
moved global gas prices one bit.</p>
<p>More importantly, Britain is part of a global gas market. If we‚Äôd
produced shale gas here, it would have been sold at the same price as
gas from Norway, Qatar, or anywhere else. The companies producing it
would have wanted to maximise their profits, not give us a discount. The
only way to force them to sell it cheaper would have been to create some
kind of special British gas market, which would have been incompatible
with our trading arrangements and probably illegal under various
international agreements.</p>
<p>So shale gas wouldn‚Äôt have made gas cheaper in Britain. But it would
have meant that more of the money we spend on gas stayed in Britain
rather than going abroad.</p>
<h2 id="the-environmental-case">The environmental case</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. Despite what many
environmentalists assumed, shale gas might actually have been better for
the environment than the alternatives we‚Äôre using today.</p>
<p>Most of our imported gas comes as LNG from the US and Qatar. Getting
gas from the ground in the US, turning it into a liquid, shipping it
across the ocean, and turning it back into gas creates a lot of
emissions. The total lifecycle emissions for US shale LNG are around
295-310 grams of CO2 per kWh. Even Qatari LNG, which is slightly
cleaner, comes in at 285-302 grams.</p>
<p>British shale gas, by contrast, would have eliminated all those
transport emissions. The total lifecycle emissions would likely have
been around 251-268 grams of CO2 per kWh - a 15-20% reduction compared
to imported LNG.</p>
<p>This is the kind of environmental analysis that rarely gets discussed
in the heat of the shale gas debate. But it‚Äôs crucial: if your goal is
to reduce emissions, then replacing high-carbon imports with
lower-carbon domestic production makes sense.</p>
<p>The environmental benefits of gas go beyond just direct emissions
comparisons. Natural gas is fundamentally a transition fuel - much
cleaner than oil or coal, but still a fossil fuel that we‚Äôll eventually
need to phase out. However, this transition role is crucial for enabling
the clean energy technologies that will replace it. With gas fired power
providing about one-third of the current total on the grid, heat pumps
(at 350% efficiency) reduce the use of emissions and gas by about 90%
compared to a condensing gas boiler that‚Äôs 90% efficient. An EV that
travels 5km per kWh reduces total emissions by about 90% compared to a
petrol car achieving 40mpg. In both cases, electrification also shifts
emissions away from homes and people to power stations, where we might
one day be able to capture and store them.</p>
<p>This is why my support for shale gas is quite different from support
for shale oil. While gas and oil deposits often occur together, finds
that are skewed towards gas rather than oil are potentially much more
interesting from an environmental and economic perspective. Gas can play
this crucial transition role in enabling cleaner electricity and
heating.</p>
<p>Britain‚Äôs shale gas potential was particularly interesting because
the geological formations suggested gas-rich rather than oil-rich
deposits. This meant we could have developed a domestic energy source
that would have supported the transition to cleaner technologies, rather
than simply extending our dependence on high-carbon transport fuels.</p>
<h2 id="why-britain-said-no">Why Britain said no</h2>
<p>So if shale gas wouldn‚Äôt have made gas cheaper but would have created
jobs, generated tax revenue, and actually reduced emissions, why did
Britain reject it?</p>
<p>The answer is politics, pure and simple. The largest shale gas
reserves in Britain were found in politically inconvenient places. The
Bowland-Hodder formation stretches from Lancashire through Yorkshire to
Staffordshire. The Weald Basin covers parts of Surrey, Sussex,
Hampshire, and Kent.</p>
<p>Lancashire alone contained four marginal constituencies where the
Conservative majority was less than 1.5% in the 2019 election. These
weren‚Äôt constituencies where the government could afford to lose votes.
Meanwhile, the Weald Basin covers affluent Surrey constituencies like
Surrey Heath and Woking, which are home to wealthy donors and
politically connected individuals who can make their feelings known in
ways that matter to politicians.</p>
<p>The opposition took different forms in different places. In
Lancashire, there was genuine grassroots concern about the environmental
impact. In Surrey, there was more organised, well-funded opposition from
affluent residents who didn‚Äôt want drilling anywhere near their
expensive homes.</p>
<p>Had the shale reserves been located in different parts of the country
- perhaps in rural areas with fewer marginal seats - the politics might
have been very different. But they weren‚Äôt, and so the government chose
to protect the electoral interests of a few key constituencies over the
economic interests of the country as a whole.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of how energy policy gets made in Britain.
What should be a decision based on energy security, economics, and
environmental impact becomes a calculation about electoral maths and
political pressure.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-lost">What we lost</h2>
<p>The economic impact of Britain‚Äôs shale gas ban is hard to quantify
precisely, but it‚Äôs substantial. We lost the chance to create thousands
of jobs in regions that could really use them. We lost billions in
potential tax revenue. We became more dependent on foreign gas
suppliers, which means we‚Äôre more vulnerable to global energy price
shocks.</p>
<p>More importantly, we lost the chance to build up domestic energy
expertise and infrastructure. The skills and equipment needed for shale
gas development could have formed the foundation for other energy
industries. The gas processing and distribution networks could have
supported other energy technologies.</p>
<p>We also lost credibility as a place to invest in energy projects. If
Britain can‚Äôt develop its own energy resources because of political
opposition, why should companies invest in other energy projects here?
This kind of policy uncertainty makes it harder to attract the
investment we need for wind, solar, and other energy technologies.</p>
<h2 id="the-bigger-lesson">The bigger lesson</h2>
<p>Britain‚Äôs shale gas experience reveals something important about how
we make energy policy decisions. Too often, we let short-term political
considerations override long-term national interests. We let local
opposition from vocal minorities prevent developments that would benefit
the country as a whole.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt to say that local concerns don‚Äôt matter. They do. But
there needs to be a better way to balance local interests with national
needs. Perhaps we need better ways to compensate communities that host
energy infrastructure. Perhaps we need better processes for weighing
environmental risks against economic benefits.</p>
<p>As Britain faces similar challenges with nuclear power, offshore
wind, transmission lines, and other energy infrastructure, the lessons
from shale gas become even more relevant. We can‚Äôt afford to let every
energy project get bogged down in local politics. We need to find ways
to make energy policy decisions that serve the national interest while
respecting local concerns.</p>
<p>The shale gas story also shows how important it is to base energy
policy on evidence rather than emotion. The environmental case against
shale gas was often based on fears rather than facts. The economic case
was often oversold by its supporters. We need better, more honest
discussions about the real costs and benefits of different energy
options.</p>
<p>Britain‚Äôs energy future depends on making better decisions about how
to balance environmental protection, economic development, and energy
security. If we can‚Äôt get this basic calculation right for shale gas,
how are we going to make the much more complex decisions about nuclear
power, renewable energy, and carbon capture that lie ahead?</p>
<p>The shale gas opportunity is gone. But the need for better energy
policy decision-making remains. Let‚Äôs hope we learn the right lessons
from this missed opportunity.</p>

20: Power Versus Other Sectors - Energy‚Äôs Place in the Economy</h1>
<h2 id="power-generation-versus-other-emissions">Power Generation versus
other emissions</h2>
<p>This book is focused largely on energy and specifically electricity.
Electricity is expected to be the dominant energy of the future, and is
expected to supplant the use of fossil and biomass fuels in most use
cases of the 21st century economy. So considering our evolving
generation mix is particularly important both and into the future, as
the volume of electricity we consume is expected to grow.</p>
<p>That said, in the context of the wider challenge to decarbonise and
stop climate change, it‚Äôs important to see the wider context of how
progress in power generation compares to uses of energy.</p>
<p>Countries sign up to climate targets in a number of areas:</p>
<p><strong>Emissions targets</strong> There are targets on overall
country emissions, such as those agreed at the UN sponsored Conference
of Parties (or CoP talks), including the Paris, Copenhagen and Kyoto
agreements. These targets are typically in reference to a base emission
year (typically 1990), with different consideration for developing
countries including rapidly growing China, India etc.</p>
<p>Carbon emissions trading schemes like the EU (and now UK) fit within
these targets. They can cover a broad range of sectoral emissions,
including aviation, heavy industry and although not yet typically
included, potentially agriculture in the future.</p>
<p>As such, these schemes allow for tradeoffs in emission reductions to
occur between sectors like power generation and agriculture, rather than
being specific or imposing constraints on a specific sector to play a
minimum role. Economists like this arrangement because it allows for
flexibility and market forces to guide where investment gets the most
efficient payback with respect to the emissions avoided. So, it
emissions reductions are much cheaper and easier in let‚Äôs say power
generation compared to aviation (which still relies almost 100% on
aviation kerosene as a fuel), then this allows for the aviation sector
to buy carbon permits off the power generation sector, which can use
these to build more wind and solar farms.</p>
<p><strong>Renewable Electricity Targets</strong> In addition to broader
carbon targets, there have been specific renewable electricity targets
imposed either at state/provincial level (e.g.¬†California), national
(e.g.¬†UK) or international (e.g.¬†EU) level. These target only the power
generation sector, and can exclude the contribution of older renewables
like hydro and low carbon (but not technically renewable) nuclear
power.</p>
<p>The EU renewable electricity obligations are particularly strict and
binding because they are binding individually on each member state and
don‚Äôt allow trading of obligations between each other. So a member state
like France, which has &gt;x% of power generation from nuclear power, is
nonetheless obliged to achieve over x% of generation from new renewable
technologies like wind and solar. While some wind and solar projects are
merited in France, the French grid is relatively saturated by its
nuclear generation, and in many instances in summer, the French grid
operator is effectively curtailing (or turning down) nuclear generation
purely to accomodate solar PV (and wind) generation on the grid, which
are needed in sufficient quantities across the year to meet France‚Äôs EU
renewables target of x% from reneables by the year x. In actual fact,
this whole excercise is rather pointless, because the emissions from
solar and wind are similar to those from the French nuclear plant,
especially at the margin when the nuclear plant might well be turned on
anyway.</p>
<p>The short answer is that, while it‚Äôs safe, turning down nuclear
generatio for France is pretty pointless, in most cases the only way to
do it involves blowing large amounts of steam into the atmosphere to
disappate the heat generated by the reactor. France might just as well
curtail its solar generation, but for the obligation the EU imposes on
it to generate a certain fraction of its electricity specifically from
renewable generation. There is almost no additional marginal emissions
of carbon from the nuclear generation.</p>
<p>Another inefficiency of national targets is the inability of EU
member states to outsource renewable generation to other countries. For
example, there is x GW of solar PV capacity in Germany, but only x GW in
Spain and x GW in Italy. This is despite both Spain and Italy being
signficantly sunnier than Germany. Had Germany found a way to invest in
solar PV generation across Spain, it could have invested in assets that
yielded x kwh of carbon free electricity a year, compared to a maxium of
about x kwh per year in Southern Germany. EU emissions as a whole could
have been reduced at lesser overall cost or expense to EU households and
businesses. However, national priorities continue to take precedence
over broader EU objectives.</p>
<h2 id="uk-emission-targets">UK Emission Targets</h2>
<p>The UK is actually doing quite well on each of the shorter term
emission targets it has signed up to:</p>
<p><strong>Kyoto Protocol</strong> - The 1997 international treaty where
developed countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The
UK exceeded its Kyoto target of 12.5% reduction below 1990 levels by
2012, achieving a 23% reduction. <strong>Status: Exceeded
target.</strong></p>
<p><strong>EU 2020 Targets</strong> - While the UK has left the EU, it
was previously bound by the EU‚Äôs 2020 climate and energy package, which
included a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 20% renewable
energy share, and 20% improvement in energy efficiency compared to 1990
levels. <strong>Status: Met emissions target (43% reduction), exceeded
renewable target (42% share), exceeded efficiency target (24-26%
improvement).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paris Agreement</strong> - The international climate accord
signed in 2015, where the UK committed to limiting global temperature
rise to well below 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to
limit it to 1.5¬∞C. The UK‚Äôs Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
pledges a 68% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.
<strong>Status: On track for 2030 target, with approximately 53-55%
reduction achieved by 2024 (provisional).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clean Power 2030</strong> - The UK government‚Äôs commitment to
decarbonise the electricity system by 2030, ensuring 95% of electricity
comes from low-carbon sources. This includes phasing out unabated
gas-fired power generation and expanding renewable energy capacity. The
target under the Conservative administration had been set to 2035; on
coming into office Labour accelerated this to 2030. <strong>Status:
Target date 2030, current progress shows approximately 58-60% low-carbon
electricity in 2024.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gas Boiler Phaseout</strong> - The UK government has set
different targets for new builds and existing homes. <strong>New
builds</strong> will be banned from installing gas boilers from 2025,
while <strong>existing homes</strong> will face a complete ban on new
gas boiler sales from 2035. This phased approach recognises the greater
difficulty of retrofitting existing properties compared to building new
homes with low-carbon heating systems from the start.</p>
<p><strong>Petrol/Diesel Vehicle Phaseout</strong> - The UK has
committed to ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by
2030, with hybrid vehicles allowed until 2035. This target was
originally set by the Conservative government in 2020 and has been
maintained by Labour, aiming to accelerate the transition to electric
vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Net Zero 2050</strong> - This is by far the biggest, most
ambitious and most long-term target, encompassing all the others as
intermediate stepping stones. The legally binding target under the
Climate Change Act 2008 (amended 2019) requires achieving net zero
greenhouse gas emissions across the entire UK economy by 2050. This
covers all sectors including power, transport, buildings, industry, and
agriculture. The intermediate targets we‚Äôve already hit and in some
cases exceeded significantly are in effect the low-hanging fruit. Much
of what remains are the hardest sectors to decarbonise: transport,
buildings, and heavy industry, where emissions are deeply embedded in
infrastructure, consumer behavior, and fundamental production processes.
<strong>Status: Long-term target, progress being monitored by the
independent Climate Change Committee.</strong></p>
<p>When you dig into the composition of existing progress on the
intermediate targets, there‚Äôs considerable variation between
sectors:</p>
<p><strong>Power Generation</strong> - Has seen the most radical decline
in emissions, falling by 73% since 1990 due to coal phase-out and
renewable expansion. As recently as 2012 it was still at a staggering
40% of power generation. Coal power produces about 800g/KWh of CO2,
making it about the worst way from a climate perspective of generating
power; gas generation in contrast produces around 400g/KWh of CO2. Coal
was effectively eliminated from regular generation in 2024. Today‚Äôs
generation mix shows wind and gas as joint first/second (each around
30-35%), followed by nuclear (15%), imports (10-15%), and solar (5-10%).
Power consumption in 2024 was also around 15% lower than 1990,
reflecting energy efficiency improvements like LED lighting and general
appliances. <strong>Transport</strong> - Has seen the least progress on
emissions reduction, with only a 3% decline since 1990. Electrification
remains minimal: electric vehicles accounted for just 2% of the UK car
fleet in 2024, and electric trucks and buses are virtually non-existent.
This is despite significant efficiency improvements in internal
combustion engines - modern petrol, diesel and aviation engines are
20-30% more efficient than their 1990s counterparts. However, these
efficiency gains have been largely offset by continued growth in
transport volumes - passenger car traffic increased by 25% between 1990
and 2019, while flight passenger numbers more than doubled. The sector‚Äôs
emissions have been stubbornly resistant to policy interventions, with
road transport still responsible for around 90% of transport emissions
and aviation for most of the rest. <strong>Buildings</strong> - Have
seen moderate progress with emissions falling by around 25% since 1990,
though this masks significant variation between domestic and commercial
properties. Domestic buildings have achieved the most improvement
through better insulation, more efficient boilers, and the gradual
phase-out of coal and oil heating. However, progress has been uneven -
while new builds are well insulated, the UK‚Äôs ageing housing stock
remains a major challenge. Around 85-90% of homes are heated with
natural gas, with gas boilers remaining the dominant heating system and
heat pumps accounting for less than 1% of domestic heating systems
despite generous government subsidies. Commercial buildings have in some
ways fared better, with many already using air conditioning (HVAC)
systems for heating and cooling which have automatically benefitted from
the improvements in power generation. However many older commercial
buildings remain poorly insulated by international standards, and the
prevalence of renting creates little incentive for landlords to invest
in energy efficiency upgrades. The policy inconsistency is striking -
domestic buildings face no carbon pricing on their gas consumption,
while large commercial buildings are subject to the Climate Change Levy,
creating a perverse incentive to keep gas boilers in homes while
commercial properties face pressure to electrify.
<strong>Industry</strong> - Has seen significant progress with emissions
falling by around 45% since 1990, though this masks dramatic variation
between sectors and the reality of offshoring. Heavy industry like
steel, cement and chemicals has achieved improvement through process
efficiency gains, fuel switching from coal to gas, and the closure of
some of the most carbon-intensive facilities. However, much of this
apparent progress reflects the offshoring of carbon-intensive production
to countries with lower environmental standards - Britain‚Äôs steel,
cement and chemical production has declined significantly since 1990,
while imports from high-emission countries have increased. The sector‚Äôs
emissions have been more responsive to policy interventions than
transport or buildings, but this is partly because carbon pricing and
efficiency standards made it cheaper to import than produce
domestically. The high cost of deep decarbonisation technologies like
hydrogen and carbon capture remains a significant barrier, while
offshoring continues to shift emissions rather than eliminate them.
<strong>Agriculture</strong> - Has seen modest progress with emissions
falling by around 15% since 1990, though this masks significant changes
in both production methods and consumption patterns. The sector has
achieved improvements through better fertiliser management, reduced
methane emissions from livestock, and some efficiency gains in crop
production. However, progress has been uneven - while some farmers have
adopted more sustainable practices, others continue with intensive
methods that maximise yields at the expense of environmental impact. The
most significant change has been in dietary habits, with per capita meat
consumption declining by around 15% since 1990, particularly red meat,
which has the highest carbon footprint. However, this reduction has been
partially offset by population growth and increased consumption of dairy
products. Much of the apparent progress reflects the offshoring of food
production to countries with lower environmental standards, with UK food
self-sufficiency declining from around 75% in 1990 to under 60% today.
The sector‚Äôs emissions have been relatively resistant to policy
interventions, with the post-Brexit Environmental Land Management scheme
replacing the EU‚Äôs Common Agricultural Policy but still struggling to
balance food production with environmental goals. The continued tax
breaks on red diesel for agricultural machinery actively encourage
high-emission practices, while the high cost of transitioning to
regenerative farming practices and the lack of carbon pricing on
agricultural emissions remain significant barriers to faster
decarbonisation. <strong>Waste</strong> - Has seen significant progress
with emissions falling by around 60% since 1990, though this masks
important distinctions between different types of emissions and broader
environmental benefits. The sector has achieved dramatic reductions in
methane emissions from landfill through improved gas capture systems and
the gradual phase-out of organic waste disposal. Methane is the same
chemical molecule as natural gas; when released unburnt into the
atmosphere it is a different greenhouse gas to CO2, but with 25 times
more global warming potential over a 100-year period. However, progress
outside methane has been more mixed. The UK‚Äôs recycling rates have
improved from around 5% in 1990 to over 45% today, reducing the need for
virgin materials and their associated emissions. However, much of this
apparent progress reflects the offshoring of waste processing to
countries with lower environmental standards, particularly for plastics
and electronics. The sector‚Äôs emissions have been more responsive to
policy interventions than transport or buildings, with landfill taxes
and recycling targets driving meaningful change. However, the high cost
of advanced waste treatment technologies and the continued export of
difficult-to-recycle materials remain significant barriers to achieving
truly sustainable waste management.</p>
<h2 id="decarbonisation-of-power-generation-is-broader">Decarbonisation
of power generation is broader</h2>
<p>The stark variation in progress between sectors reveals a fundamental
challenge for the UK‚Äôs net zero ambitions. While some sectors like power
generation have achieved dramatic emissions reductions, others like
transport and buildings remain stubbornly resistant to policy
interventions. This uneven progress suggests that the UK has exhausted
most of the ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit‚Äù - the relatively easy emissions
reductions from fuel switching, efficiency improvements, and
technological upgrades.</p>
<p>In the contemporary narrative, there is a perception that the power
generation sector in Britain in particular has failed to decarbonise at
an affordable cost. While there are many mistakes documented in this
book which explain how the decarbonisation of power generation has
undertaken could have been cheaper, we need to acknowledge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Power generation started in a relatively poor position. Unlike
countries with significant hydro (Nordics) and nuclear (France)
generation, Britain was highly dependent on coal generation. As a
result, it has gone through two transitions over 30 years:
<ul>
<li>First, moving from coal to gas (1990s-2000s)</li>
<li>Second, moving from gas toward wind, solar and greater imports
(2010s-2020s)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The investments in power generation e.g.¬†synergising new
technologies like wind and solar, are foundations upon which much of the
upcoming decarbonisation of buildings, transport, industry will be
built. The challenge for the power generation sector is also much
broader given the dependency on electrification of decarbonisation to
other sectors like transport, buildings and industry. UK electricity
demand could double, from about 300TWh/year to 600 TWh/year by
2050.</li>
<li>If buildings, transport and industry had decarbonised faster over
the last 30 years, the power sector would have struggled to meet the
increased electricity demand with clean generation. The explosive growth
of data centres and AI computing is creating unprecedented electricity
demand that was never anticipated in early decarbonisation plans,
potentially derailing progress on power sector emissions. UK data
centres already consume around 15 TWh annually - equivalent to 5% of
total electricity demand - and this could triple by 2030 as AI
applications scale up, adding another 30 TWh of demand that wasn‚Äôt
factored into net zero planning.</li>
<li>The shift toward gas for power generation coincided with the decline
of domestic reserves in the North Sea and closure of UK coal pits. Even
with Clean Power 2030, unless there is a rapid acceleration of Building
decarbonisation in particular, we will remain very exposed to LNG
imports especially in the winter months. That said, given that coal
supplies were frequently disrupted by industrial action in the
1970s/80s, this instability isn‚Äôt that novel to the UK.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="perfection-versus-pragmatism">Perfection versus pragmatism</h2>
<h3 id="going-coal-free">Going coal free</h3>
<p>Considerable media attention was given as, one-by-one over the last
15 years, coal plants were decommissioned across Britain. These moments
were significant for the workforce and local communities, marking the
end of decades of industrial heritage.</p>
<h4 id="non-carbon-emissions">Non Carbon Emissions</h4>
<p>In some instances, coal plants were retired earlier than expected
primarilly due to local air pollution concerns rather than climate
change. Cockenzie near Edinburgh closed in 2013 after failing LCPD
compliance on sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, while
Kingsnorth in Kent (30 miles from London) was mothballed in 2012 rather
than invest in expensive emissions control equipment. The health impacts
of coal pollution are severe and well-documented. A 2016 EU study found
coal plants in Britain contributed to around 1,600 premature deaths
annually, with communities within 30 miles of power stations showing
significantly higher rates of respiratory diseases, heart conditions,
and certain cancers.</p>
<h4 id="carbon-free-hours">Carbon Free Hours</h4>
<p>Similarly, in the energy sphere, there was for much of the last 5-10
years a fixation on the number of coal-free running hours on the
national grid. As coal plants retired, these periods extended
dramatically, so that by the time the last few coal plants remained at
Radcliffe on Soar and West Burton, coal generation was only used during
the coldest weeks of winter when demand peaked and renewable generation
was low. At various points, these coal power plants in their final were
also operated under emergency reserve contracts by National Grid rather
than selling their output on the open market.</p>
<h4 id="lost-opportunity---given-our-lack-of-gas-storage">Lost
Opportunity - given our lack of gas storage</h4>
<p>More generally, what matters is the total volume of carbon emissions
from all generation sources combined. While there‚Äôs something discrete
and tangible about whether coal power stations remain on the grid, the
broader question is whether Britain has truly moved beyond fossil fuel
dependency.</p>
<p>In the coming 5-10 years, legitimate concerns exist about the power
grid‚Äôs capacity to meet peak energy demands, particularly as heat pump
adoption accelerates. While these risks are often amplified by climate
sceptics seeking to discredit renewable technologies, dismissing them
entirely would be unwise. The reality lies somewhere between alarmist
rhetoric and complacent optimism.</p>
<p>One of the UK‚Äôs biggest energy weaknesses is its lack of gas storage.
The UK has only around 1.5 TWh of gas storage, enough for about 4-5 days
of supply. Given the proximity of the North Sea, gas storage was never
seen as a priority. In countries with longer traditions of importing
gas, such as Germany, there is around 24 TWh of gas storage, which can
meet 80-90 days of peak winter demand.</p>
<p>This vulnerability is compounded by a fundamental characteristic of
British winter weather: air temperature is negatively correlated with
wind speed. British winters typically oscillate between two weather
modes: low-pressure systems bringing mild, wet, windy conditions from
the Atlantic, or high-pressure systems bringing cold, dry weather from
the east. The former is excellent for wind generation and reduces
electric heating demand, especially with heat pumps that are 250%
efficient at 10¬∞C but only 200% efficient at 0¬∞C. The latter is poor for
wind generation (though cold air is denser and can improve wind turbine
performance slightly) and dramatically increases electric heating
demand.</p>
<p>This creates a fundamentally different energy system dynamic.
Traditionally, gas demand for heating was roughly linear with outdoor
temperature - gas boilers consumed proportionally more fuel as
temperatures dropped. But in a decarbonised heating system, the
relationship becomes exponential. When temperatures fall below freezing,
heat pump efficiency plummets while demand soars, requiring massive
amounts of electricity generation. Since this electricity must come from
gas-fired backup plants during Dunkelflaute events, the gas demand curve
becomes much steeper and more volatile than the old linear
relationship.</p>
<p>The result is a perfect storm: the weather conditions that maximise
heating demand (cold, still) simultaneously minimise renewable
generation (no wind), while the conditions that maximise renewable
generation (mild, windy) minimise heating demand.</p>
<p>Even as UK gas consumption declines with home decarbonisation,
switching between these weather modes could create significant swings in
gas demand for power generation. While the absolute volatility of gas
demand will certainly fall as fewer homes use gas directly for heating,
in relative terms it could actually increase. With a smaller overall gas
market, the same absolute demand swing represents a larger percentage
change, making the system more sensitive to weather variations and
supply disruptions. This volatility exposes the fundamental weakness of
relying on gas as the primary backup for renewables.</p>
<p>Given this challenge, it could have made sense to maintain some coal
power stations as strategic reserves. Unlike gas power plants, coal can
be stored in dense form adjacent to power stations without the massive
investment required for underground gas storage infrastructure. A week
or two‚Äôs supply of coal would have been sufficient to manage many 1-in-5
or 1-in-10 year cold snaps, or to handle unexpected disruptions like
sabotage of undersea cables or LNG terminals. Such strategic reserves
would have provided a crucial buffer against the volatility of the
decarbonised energy system while requiring minimal ongoing
investment.</p>
<p>The human cost of energy system failures during extreme weather
events should be weighed against the environmental damage from
short-term coal generation. Prolonged blackouts in winter, particularly
for vulnerable populations, could result in significant health
consequences and economic disruption. Decarbonisation policy needs to
balance these competing concerns.</p>
<p>The economics of maintaining such reserves are not trivial - the UK
already spends ¬£21 per household annually on the Capacity Market to keep
backup power plants available. However, the cost of maintaining
mothballed coal plants as strategic reserves would likely be
significantly lower than building new gas storage infrastructure,
particularly when accounting for the value of energy security during
extreme events.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-compromises">Hybrid compromises</h3>
<p>Until power grids are 100% renewable, all heat pumps and electric
vehicles connected to the grid will effectively run on a mixture of
fossil fuel-generated power and renewables. The exact split depends on
when they‚Äôre used and what weather conditions prevail at that moment. A
heat pump running on a cold, still winter evening might be powered 80%
by gas and 20% by renewables, while the same heat pump on a windy spring
afternoon might run 90% on renewables.</p>
<p>On average for a heatpump, a recent <a
href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w33036/w33036.pdf">study</a>
by academics working for Octopus Energy estimated the current reduction
in gas usage being around 90%. That figure accorded with rough
hyptothetical calculations I did on my own home (about 85%); and the
saving figure will trend up to reach 100% as the rest of the grid
decarbonises. For the UK‚Äôs energy security as a net importer of gas this
is a big improvement; and heating buildings accounts for around 40% of
our current use of natural gas.</p>
<p>The principal deterrent to heat pump installation is often the
upfront capital cost, particularly in older buildings with poor
insulation or limited space for the larger radiators and hot water
cylinders that heat pumps require. Heat pumps work most efficiently at
lower flow temperatures (typically 35-45¬∞C) compared to gas boilers
(60-80¬∞C), which means they need significantly more radiator surface
area to deliver the same heat output. This usually requires either
upgrading to larger radiators or installing underfloor heating systems,
which provide even greater surface area but are expensive and disruptive
to retrofit. Current regulations for government grants demand systems
capable of heating homes to comfortable temperatures even on the coldest
winter days - typically when outdoor temperatures reach -1¬∞C in the
south of England to -3¬∞C in northern Scotland. For such challenging
properties, hybrid heat pump systems could offer a practical
compromise.</p>
<p>Similar to plug-in hybrid cars that switch between battery power and
petrol, hybrid heat pump systems could meet 80-90% of a building‚Äôs
heating needs with electricity, using gas or oil only as backup during
extreme cold when heat pumps become inefficient and the power grid is
strained. For rural properties, this backup could also include
wood-burning stoves or open fires, which many homeowners install anyway
for aesthetic or practical reasons. Such secondary heating systems
provide crucial resilience during power cuts, which are becoming more
frequent and severe due to climate change and increasingly extreme
weather events. By taking the strain off heat pumps at lower
temperatures, this secondary heating also boosts the average efficiency
of the heat pump system overall, since heat pumps operate most
efficiently when not pushed to their performance limits. This hybrid
approach would reduce both the upfront cost of retrofitting and the
broader grid infrastructure costs needed to support full
electrification, while also boosting consumer confidence by addressing
the fear - however well-founded - that heat pumps might not work in all
conditions. This inertia was and still is an important decision factor,
similar to range anxiety with EVs.</p>
<p>Another hybrid approach keeps the existing combi boiler for hot water
while adding air-to-air heat pumps for space heating and cooling. This
gives homeowners unlimited hot water on demand without sacrificing floor
space to a water cylinder. The air-to-air system - essentially
reversible air conditioning - provides both heating in winter and
cooling in summer, making it particularly attractive for urban
properties like small flats and terraced houses that often overheat
during warm weather.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the Government hasn‚Äôt yet considered either of these
hybrid options, though it is considering air to air heatpumps for
properties with an electric cylinder or way of heating water.</p>
<p><strong>The perfection trap</strong> This obsession with achieving
perfect, 100% renewable electricity before electrifying other sectors
creates a dangerous delay. Britain could have made much faster progress
on transport and building decarbonisation by accepting that
electrification would initially be partially fossil-fuel powered, rather
than waiting for the perfect renewable grid. The result is that sectors
that could have been electrifying for the past decade are still waiting
for the power sector to achieve perfection, while emissions from
transport and buildings continue largely unabated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-the-perfectionism-paradox">Conclusion: The
Perfectionism Paradox</h2>
<p>The UK‚Äôs decarbonisation journey reveals a fundamental tension
between two approaches to climate action. On one side stands the
perfectionist approach: waiting for complete renewable energy systems
before electrifying other sectors, insisting on 100% clean solutions,
and rejecting any technology that doesn‚Äôt achieve zero emissions. On the
other side stands pragmatism: accepting incremental progress, embracing
hybrid systems, and recognising that partial decarbonisation today often
achieves more than perfect decarbonisation tomorrow.</p>
<p>The evidence from Britain‚Äôs energy transition is clear. The power
sector has achieved a 73% emissions reduction since 1990, largely
through the ‚Äúdash for gas‚Äù and renewable expansion. Yet transport
emissions have fallen by only 3%, and building emissions by just 25%.
This stark contrast reflects not technological limitations, but policy
choices that prioritized perfect solutions over practical progress.</p>
<p>The perfectionist approach has created several perverse outcomes. By
eliminating coal entirely rather than maintaining strategic reserves,
Britain has increased its vulnerability to gas supply disruptions during
extreme weather events. By insisting on full heat pump adoption rather
than hybrid systems, the government has slowed building decarbonisation
and increased costs for homeowners. By waiting for perfect renewable
grids before electrifying transport, Britain has delayed the transition
to electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The pragmatic alternative recognises that decarbonisation is a
journey, not a destination. Hybrid heat pump systems that achieve 60-70%
emissions reductions are better than no heat pumps at all. Strategic
coal reserves that provide energy security during extreme events are
better than blackouts that endanger vulnerable populations. Partial
electrification that begins immediately is better than perfect
electrification that never starts.</p>
<p>This is not an argument for abandoning climate ambitions or accepting
continued fossil fuel dependence. Rather, it‚Äôs a recognition that the
path to net zero requires balancing environmental goals with practical
constraints, economic realities, and human welfare considerations. The
UK‚Äôs current approach of eliminating coal entirely while building
massive offshore wind capacity has created a system that‚Äôs both more
expensive and less resilient than necessary.</p>
<p>The lesson for policymakers is clear: perfect should not be the enemy
of good. Britain‚Äôs energy system would benefit from embracing hybrid
approaches, maintaining strategic reserves, and accepting that
decarbonisation happens in stages. The goal should be maximum emissions
reduction at minimum cost and disruption, not ideological purity at any
price.</p>
<p>As the UK faces the challenge of doubling electricity demand by 2050
while maintaining energy security, the choice between perfectionism and
pragmatism becomes increasingly urgent. The perfectionist approach risks
creating an energy system that‚Äôs both expensive and fragile, while the
pragmatic approach offers a path to rapid, cost-effective
decarbonisation that builds resilience rather than vulnerability.</p>
<p>The question is not whether Britain should decarbonise - that‚Äôs
already decided. The question is how to do it in a way that maximises
environmental benefits while minimizing economic and social costs. The
answer lies not in waiting for perfect solutions, but in embracing the
messy, incremental reality of energy transitions. Britain‚Äôs energy
future depends on choosing pragmatism over perfectionism, and progress
over purity.</p>
