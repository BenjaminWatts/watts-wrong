            <h1>Chapter 8: Regional Privatisation Model - How Fragmentation Hurts</h1>
<h2>Pre-privatisation</h2>
<p>Prior to privatisation in the 1990s, the electricity system in Britain comprised of:</p>
<p>-- <strong>CEGB</strong>: transmission grid and all power stations
-- <strong>Regional Electricity Boards</strong>: local distribution cables and retail (tariffs, billing etc) - there were 12 in total
-- <strong>Scotland</strong>: 2 verticallly integrated power companies</p>
<p>The decision to privatise is well doumented elsewhere. One of the main objectives was to create retail competition as a downward pressure on prices. However there were a number of issues:</p>
<p>__ <strong>Existing integration</strong>: the regional grids were integrated with the local retail operations 
-- <strong>Barriers to entry</strong>: enticing completely new entrants to a new market seemed unlikely</p>
<h2>Privatisation</h2>
<p>So as a privatisation roadmap in 1990, the decision was taken to:</p>
<p>-- Preserve separate network companies in each region. Though eventually these were allowed to merge with each other and share some management functions, the 12 (14 including Scotland) regions are still largely regulated separately.
-- Allow each of the regional companies over time to compete outside their existing area. </p>
<p>The world has changed a lot since 1990. Back then, having regional organisations made a lot more sense, but this is much less true today because of:</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong> </p>
<p>In 1990, regional electricity companies were installing, maintaining and manually reading electricity meters, creating quarterly bills and taking cash/cheque payments. Aside from field engineers, many of their employees were clerical, working in regional call centres. They had no technology platforms (websites, apps) - systems that have largely fixed costs but can scale to any number of users. Marketing wasn&#39;t a priority, there was no need to attract/win over customers, there were a handful of tariffs. With no switching, the volume of customers joining or leaving the supplier was much smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucratisation</strong></p>
<p>The cost of management and administration has soared. Executive pay at Distribution Network Operators has increased dramatically since 1990 - from around £50,000-80,000 for senior managers in the public sector Regional Electricity Boards to £500,000-£2 million for CEOs of today&#39;s DNOs. Even accounting for inflation (where £1 in 1990 is worth about £2.50 today), this represents a real increase of 2.5x to 16x in executive compensation. The broader cost of management, administration, and corporate overhead has grown from around 5-8% of total costs in 1990 to 15-20% today. This is because having a privatised structure creates more executive and management jobs at the government regulator (Ofgem), as well as an army of consultants and accountants that support the marathon price control process. Every few years, companies negotiate with regulators and are eventually told how much, as monopolies, they are allowed to charge customers. Having 14 regional areas means this process and cost is replicated 14 times.</p>
<p><strong>Outdated Remuneration</strong></p>
<p>Under privatisation, network companies get a guaranteed return on capital for every pound of assets, be it pylons, substations or pipelines. Given this, the assumption is that left to their own devices, the network company will want to invest more than is strictly necessary, and that the regulator is therefore required to limit their expenditure, which they do within the price control.</p>
<p>To be fair, this process can work quite neatly when not much is changing. The budgeting process takes last year&#39;s figures as a starting point, and the main action each year is that some assets nearing the end of their working life get replaced, an inflation increase is applied, and companies get some productivity targets. This was broadly the world that existed up until the 2010s, but since then we&#39;ve been radically departing from this stable model for the following reasons:</p>
<h2>Peak Gas</h2>
<p>Gas currently reaches around 85-90% of British homes. Until recently, it was the standard assumption that new build homes and particularly houses would have a gas connection. The expected move to heat pumps means this is no longer the case, and as existing homes start the process of retrofitting heat pumps, over time fewer and fewer homes will have a gas connection. However, as this process isn&#39;t co-ordinated, gas network companies are in most places still going to have to maintain a similar mileage of network but with fewer customers, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>This creates a fundamental problem with the privatised network model. From the Government, consumer, and environment&#39;s perspective it makes sense over time to abandon the gas network. However, from the perspective of a privatised gas network company, the incentive is to maximise the returns from the assets they have for the longest potential period. At the moment, for example, they have a particularly strong incentive to replace any infrastructure (such as any remaining old steel pipes) with new plastic ones, as this will get from the regulator a guaranteed return on these new assets for 15-25 years.</p>
<p>The regional structure compounds this problem. With 8 regional gas networks, each facing similar challenges, there&#39;s no coordinated approach to managing the decline. Each company fights to maintain its customer base and asset value, even when the overall system would benefit from economies of scale. The result is likely to be higher costs for remaining customers and slower progress toward net zero, as the privatised model prioritises shareholder returns over system efficiency.</p>
<p>Worse still, this legacy burden is likely to fall most acutely on poorer households that are slower to embrace heat pumps and other low-carbon technologies. As wealthier households transition away from gas, the remaining customers will face higher bills to maintain the same network infrastructure. This creates a regressive effect where the costs of the energy transition are borne disproportionately by those least able to afford them, while the benefits accrue to those who can afford to upgrade their heating systems first. </p>
<h2>Demand Electrification</h2>
<p>The local electricity distribution cables for a typical residential home were designed to support demand from each house of around 1-2 kW. As the lifetime of cables and substations is around 40-50 years, the average age of kit out there was designed over 20-30 years ago. An EV charger of the size typically recommended uses 7 kW, which is 3-7 times more than the original design capacity. A heat pump in a typical home might use 3-5 kW in peak winter times in addition. If one or two homes in a street get these upgrades, the network can typically cope and gradually expand. But if there are concentrated pockets (e.g., where neighbours copy each other), then this can create problems for network companies.</p>
<p>This creates a fundamental problem with the privatised model. From the Government, consumer, and environment&#39;s perspective, rapid network expansion is needed to support the energy transition. However, from the perspective of privatised electricity network companies, the incentive is to maximise returns on existing assets while minimising risky new investment. The regulatory price control process, designed to prevent over-investment, now acts as a barrier to the rapid expansion needed for net zero.</p>
<p>The regional structure compounds this problem. With 14 separate electricity distribution networks, each facing similar electrification challenges, there&#39;s no coordinated approach to strategic network planning. Each company makes investment decisions based on local regulatory incentives rather than national energy transition needs. The result is likely to be slower electrification progress, higher costs from piecemeal upgrades, and a system that prioritises regulatory compliance over strategic network development. </p>
<h2>Debt</h2>
<p>The privatised structure has also led to concerning trends in leverage and gearing across Britain&#39;s network companies. Electricity and gas distribution companies have increasingly loaded up on debt, with gearing ratios (debt to equity) rising from 20-30% pre-privatisation to 60-70% in the early 2010s to 80-90% today. This mirrors the pattern seen in water companies, where high leverage was used to extract dividends and reduce tax bills, creating what became known as &quot;financial engineering&quot; rather than real operational efficiency. This shift has also changed the financial risk profile of Britain&#39;s energy infrastructure, making it more vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and market volatility.</p>
<p>Since 2022, this high leverage has become a major problem. Rising interest rates have dramatically increased the cost of servicing this debt, with many companies now facing interest costs that are 2-3 times higher than they were just a few years ago. The regulator&#39;s response has been to allow these higher financing costs to be passed through to consumers, but this creates a vicious cycle where higher bills reduce demand, which increases the per-customer cost burden, leading to even higher bills. </p>
